13253,fw : producer one update,"louise ,
i think what i really wanted to convey is the following :
1 . john grass originally headed up the wellhead desk and outsourcing efforts for the producer segment . i wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services .
2 . when the volume of the wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of "" contract focus "" with ocean energy , andex , and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued , i asked kevin miller to manage producer outsourcing and john grass to manage only the wellhead desk .
3 . based on kevin miller ' s memo ( attached below ) , the wellhead desk reporting into hunter , i have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the wellhead desk .

12946,eol organization,"can brad richter and savita puthigai attend the next trader meeting you have to let all the traders know that savita and her organization ( call center , product control , business analysis , trader support , etc . ) now report officially to brad richter going forward and not jay webb ?
savita and i discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now . savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001 , getting in some new talent in her group , training brad , working with webb , taking care of the traders , etc . i will talk with her in december or january about what might be next for her .
jay webb is also supportive of this . when he and i agreed that savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large , complex development job , he said brad should take the role . jay works well with brad and thinks brad , with time , will work well in andy zipper ' s old role . jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for enrononline and will be working closely with brad and savita .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

12830,competitive analysis update # 10 - us terrorism attacks,"a . market updates
u . s . markets
? us equity markets are closed today but may open friday . nyse / nasdaq / amex officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart .
? chicago markets ( cbot / cme ) closed early at 1 : 00 pm cdt , cbot electronic a / c / e trading expected to resume tonight for grains , and resumption of all commodities under consideration .
? nymex : still closed , electronic access trading planned to open later tonight ( start time still under consideration )
? in equity news , frightened travelers are expected to avoid planes once carriers resume flying , prompting standard & poor ' s to consider cutting the long - term credit ratings of all u . s . airlines , british airways and air canada . that would raise borrowing costs and worsen the industry ' s least profitable year in a decade . the losses at u . s . airlines , until this week predicted to reach $ 2 . 6 billion , may now rival the $ 4 . 8 billion loss of 1992 .
? in europe , the four biggest airlines - - british airways , deutsche lufthansa ag , air france sa and klm royal dutch airlines nv - - will all now post a full - year loss due to their reliance on profits from the trans - atlantic market .
? in asia , services to and from the u . s . contribute 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue at cathay pacific airways and singapore airlines ltd . some $ 3 . 8 billion was wiped off the market value of airlines based in hong kong , singapore , tokyo and other asian capitals in two days . the plunge in stocks reduced the value of asia ' s eight biggest carriers by about 14 percent .
b . transportation / infrastructure updates
air travel
? 145 domestic airports have now been cleared to reopen , though logan international airport will remain closed indefinitely , despite the federal aviation authority ' s decision to open u . s . airspace for commercial airplanes .
? at least some regularly scheduled united airlines flights are expected to begin at 7 p . m . edt thursday , and some scheduled flights on american airlines and twa after 4 p . m . edt . delta air lines said "" very limited operations "" would start sometime after noon edt thursday . continental has canceled all regularly scheduled flights for the day , but planned to offer special service in cities such as san francisco and cleveland .
maritime transportation
? open , including ny harbor , which is doing individual vessels inspections and escorts into the harbor
c . political updates
? indications are beginning to point to a substantial military strike against bin laden assets in afghanistan as well as the taleban government .
lawrence b . lindsey , the president ' s chief economic adviser : "" we ' ve been working on getting the basic infrastructure of america up and running again , that ' s the main thing we ' ve been doing . ""
world bank officials want to cancel their annual meeting in conjunction with the international monetary fund , now slated for sept . 28 - 29 in washington , according to media reports . the dc police have also asked that the meetings be cancelled , but world bank officials must wait for treasury secretary o ' neill to make the decision . bank officials fear the bush administration will want the meeting to take place to underscore that washington is back to business as usual .",0

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .
