rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

16377,re : releases,"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

fall of a power giant : bailout is unlikely if enron goes under , as u . s . thinks impact would be limited

washington - - if enron corp . goes under , the government is unlikely to throw it a lifeline .
at its peak , enron was a major participant in the country ' s financial and energy markets . but economic and financial policy makers say they aren ' t worried about any broader blow to markets or business activity . despite frequent comparisons to long - term capital management , the hedge fund whose 1998 nose dive panicked global financial markets and triggered an unusual bailout brokered by the federal reserve , there has been so far no public sign of any attempt by the fed , the treasury or energy regulators to take similar action on behalf of enron or its creditors .
officials from a range of economic and regulatory agencies have insisted in recent days that while they have been closely monitoring enron ' s situation , they haven ' t seen any reason to be concerned about possible ripple effects . enron "" is just one piece of a very big market , "" said john mielke , chief of market surveillance at the commodity futures trading commission . mr . mielke said he saw no evidence that enron ' s problems have disrupted trading on the futures exchanges monitored by the cftc .
"" these are deep and pretty big markets that enron is in , "" echoed william gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas .
it is too soon to say exactly what the total damage from enron ' s potential demise will be . one danger is that a blowup in the company ' s complex , largely unregulated portfolio of derivatives could infect financial markets in wide and unpredictable ways , just as ltcm ' s did . another worry : that the collapse of a major middleman in natural - gas and power markets could disrupt supplies .
enron does share some characteristics with ltcm , including widespread activities in complicated financial instruments in numerous markets , with little detailed public explanation of those activities , and little regulatory oversight of those trades .
its public disclosures suggest enron ' s exposures are substantial . a quarterly filing listed $ 18 . 7 billion in assets and an equal amount of liabilities related to "" price risk management activities "" as of sept . 30 . the filing gives no description or breakdown of those amounts and little detail about the derivatives in which enron transacts as a normal part of business . ( a derivative is a financial contract whose value is designed to track the return on stocks , bonds , currencies or other benchmark . ) an enron spokeswoman didn ' t return a call seeking comment .
as enron ' s woes deepened , the government ' s hands were tied in even assessing the situation , in part because the company was part of a coalition of energy companies and banks that lobbied successfully three years ago against cftc efforts to expand regulation of the over - the - counter energy market . enron also worked behind the scene to head off cftc ' s direct regulation of the energy concern ' s enrononline trading operation .
there have been some signs in markets of concerns about enron fallout . interest rates on bonds of utilities and energy companies rose by one - to two - tenths of a percentage point relative to treasurys yesterday . by day ' s end , the dow jones industrial average was off 160 . 74 points , a decline blamed in part on the enron news .
those are relatively small hiccups . the betting is the impact of enron ' s troubles on the financial system will be widespread but thin . enron was a favorite borrower among lenders , and its loans were among the most widely syndicated among the banking system , both at home and abroad . for example , a $ 2 . 25 billion credit facility arranged for enron in may by citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . was distributed to 50 different institutions , according to loan pricing corp . , a credit - market research company . those syndication members sold off chunks of that debt to other investors , according to a banker at one of the underwriters .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement that it has $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines . while this exposure is expected to smart , it represents a small fraction of j . p . morgan chase ' s total assets of $ 715 billion . citigroup declined to comment on its exposure to enron , but officials familiar with the matter said the bank ' s exposure is similar to that of j . p . morgan chase .
beyond financial fallout , a concern is the potential impact on energy markets and what that could do to the economy . enron ' s troubles could hamper efforts to end the recession if the company ' s difficulties make it impossible for it to deliver natural gas or electricity to its customers .
natural - gas prices rose sharply yesterday in the minutes after three major credit - rating agencies downgraded enron ' s rating and dynegy inc . said it was calling off its purchase . but the move quickly reversed when traders digested gas - inventory numbers released in the afternoon that showed utilities have stored enough gas to meet demand ahead of the winter heating season .
"" we ' ve seen no interruptions in physical deliveries and no pricing reaction in the futures markets that you could attribute to enron , "" said scott miller , director of market development for the federal energy regulatory commission . "" revenues and transactions are occurring normally as far as we can tell . ""

enron ' s woes may ripple out to others - - - if energy company files for bankruptcy , results are likely to be messy

the sudden , deep financial troubles of enron corp . , the once aggressive , many - tentacled energy conglomerate , could have widespread consequences for scores of companies across the economy .
if enron files for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , as many investors and financial experts now expect , it is likely to be one of the messiest , most complex bankruptcy cases ever , lawyers say .
that is because of the multifaceted nature of enron ' s once highflying operations , which combined a global energy business with a massive financial - trading operation involving tens of billions of dollars in complex contracts . yesterday , amid the unraveling of a last - ditch merger with dynegy inc . , the company ' s credit was downgraded to "" junk "" status by rating agency standard & poor ' s corp . enron has about 800 trading partners or creditors .
the stock market , signaling that a bankruptcy filing is expected , hammered enron stock , which was halted for a time yesterday , and knocked lower some of its financial backers ' shares . enron shares closed at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , or 85 % . enron bonds also fell sharply , dropping to 50 cents on the dollar from around 55 cents , reflecting concerns over how much creditors might receive if the company does seek bankruptcy - court protection . j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , which have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of keeping the enron - dynegy deal alive , also saw their stocks fall . at 4 p . m . in nyse composite trading , j . p . morgan shares were down $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , while citigroup shares were down $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement it has about $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit , and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines .
other companies also disclosed their exposures to enron . exelon corp . , an energy concern in chicago , said its power - trading arm has a direct net exposure to enron of less than $ 10 million , based on its current book of business and existing market prices . exelon said its direct gross exposure based on sales to enron is less than $ 20 million . exelon said this is partly offset by $ 10 million that it owes to enron .
still , while the fallout from a potential bankruptcy filing would be widespread , federal regulators appear little concerned that it could inflict significant damage to the u . s . economy . ( see related article on page al 0 . )
the scale of the enron collapse is huge , experts say . "" there is nothing to compare it to , "" said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy specialist with coudert brothers in new york . "" the business was so large . there were so many different kinds of operating entities under the enron umbrella . ""
in a way , he added , a filing would represent all the challenges of two of the biggest bankruptcies in recent years - - this past spring ' s chapter 11 filing by pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric utility unit , and the demise of drexel burnham lambert , the wall street securities firm that failed more than a decade ago . a filing by enron , with about $ 13 billion in debt , would rank among the largest bankruptcy filings ever .
bankruptcy lawyers and creditors ' rights specialists , already swamped with a wealth of work from a boom in chapter 11 filings during the last 18 months , said they had been contacted by worried banks and other lenders to enron , seeking to retain them in the event of a chapter 11 filing . enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is exploring its options and wouldn ' t comment on whether it has retained bankruptcy counsel .
but lawyers said the company was already in discussions about retaining its own counsel . among the likely advisers is new york law firm weil gotshal the idea is to protect all parties from market risk as the value of those contracts can fluctuate from day to day , and to avoid a larger financial meltdown .
that means enron ' s counterparties are free to close out such transactions , rather than file claims in a bankruptcy proceeding reflecting the total notional amount of any trades . in other words , a securities firm that is a counterparty to enron in many financial contracts would tally up how much it owes enron under such contracts and how much enron owes it , offsetting the amounts against each other . but this process is ripe for conflicts , as disputes easily could arise over the value of the contracts .
"" it is an incredibly complex piece of financial engineering , "" andrew rahl , a bankruptcy lawyer at anderson kill & olick in new york , said of the process .
how much collateral those counterparties could seize isn ' t at all clear , either . enron was considered very aggressive in negotiating agreements such as swaps , where a party trades an obligation to pay a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate on given securities . the speed with which the company ' s finances have deteriorated further reduces the odds that its trading partners will be able to get paid anytime soon . without any security , counterparty claims would go into the probably massive general pool of claims from unsecured creditors .
besides banks and bondholders , dozens of companies , municipalities and utilities that had signed multiyear power contracts with enron may be left in the lurch . over the years , the likes of retailer j . c . penney co . , and shopping - mall company simon property group , of indianapolis , signed on with enron , as it undercut local utilities in newly deregulated markets .
any bankruptcy also is likely to trigger collateral lawsuits , as aggrieved parties look for alternative deep pockets . one possible target , analysts said , could be advisers that helped enron establish off - balance - sheet vehicles and other debt related to troubled investment partnerships , which have triggered massive losses in recent weeks . moreover , enron directors themselves could be vulnerable , too .
yesterday , enron named raymond s . troubh , a new york financial consultant , to its board as chairman of a newly formed special litigation committee to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits .
at the same time , any filing would give enron some advantages , most notably greater ease in securing financing . this is because once companies file for protection , any new cash infusion from the banks has an overriding claim on any of the company ' s assets , at the expense of previous lenders .
in addition , potential buyers for enron businesses may be more likely to emerge once the company is operating with court protection and the depth of its problems are known .
"" there is a certain comfort level that buyers have when buying a business in a chapter 11 case that doesn ' t exist when a company is struggling outside of bankruptcy , "" said keith shapiro , a bankruptcy lawyer at greenberg traurig in chicago .

credit markets
why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - s & p cries ` junk , ' but the warning comes too late

at 10 : 57 a . m . est yesterday , an announcement came out that effectively scuttled dynegy inc . ' s proposed takeover of enron corp . it was issued not by the two companies or their bankers , but by a behind - the - scenes player that was pivotal in the deal from the start .
the news came from standard & poor ' s , which lowered enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , because of concern about the energy trading company ' s financial condition . the move , followed by similar downgrades by moody ' s investors service inc . and fitch inc . several hours later , prompted dynegy to announce that it was walking away from the multibillion dollar deal .
the downgrades highlight the key role that credit - rating agencies - - which are sometimes only bit players - - are having in one of the biggest wall street dramas in years . before they became deal breakers , the ratings agencies had emerged as unlikely deal makers just a few weeks ago , by leaving enron little choice but to seek a merger partner or face a downgrade that would have made it difficult to keep running its business .
throughout the enron saga , the rating agencies found themselves the target of repeated and intense lobbying by enron , dynegy and their bankers at j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . all tried - - and ultimately failed - - to come up with assurances that the merger would bolster enron and thus protect bondholders and lenders from suffering losses .
the dramatic downgrades are sure to increase scrutiny over the role of the rating agencies in the enron situation . critics say that , in waiting until enron ' s bonds already had plummeted in value , the ratings agencies failed in their job of anticipating a company ' s financial problems and giving investors an early warning .
it now seems clear that the rating agencies , like most securities analysts , seem to have too easily accepted enron ' s murky financial reporting , which gave the impression that the company ' s balance sheet was stronger than it was . as recently as late october , both moody ' s corp . ' s moody ' s and mcgraw - hill cos . ' s & p had a solid investment - grade rating on enron ' s debt .
but since credit - rating agencies often have access to company information that securities analysts often don ' t have , the rating agencies could take some heat for not anticipating the financial difficulties . bond investors , for instance , say s & p was prematurely upbeat about enron ' s outlook earlier this month , and long ago should have demanded more information from the company . "" if the rating agencies were privy all along to information that , as near as i can tell , was nonpublic regarding these off - balance - sheet liabilities , then their judgment looks even more faulty , "" says carol levenson of gimme credit , a chicago - based analyst .
others wonder whether the ratings executives should have lowered the rating to junk days ago , when enron ' s problems became obvious . while such a move would have crippled the company ' s ability to find a suitor , holding off on the ratings move hurt stock and bond investors left holding the securities .
"" i don ' t think the consequences of a rating action should have anything to do with whether one takes that rating action or not , if one feels it ' s warranted , "" ms . levenson says . "" i don ' t think there was any doubt enron was a junk credit . ""
the ratings agencies counter that enron ' s financial condition , while weakened , became precarious only in the past few days , and given the consequences of a downgrade they needed to be prudent .
indeed , every party to the deal - - until yesterday - - kept working to provide financial infusions to enron to keep the deal alive . enron executives were particularly desperate to hold off a ratings downgrade . once the debt was lowered to junk status from investment grade , a whopping $ 3 . 9 billion of debt immediately became due , jeopardizing enron ' s ability to stay afloat .
worries about such a debt downgrade weeks ago pushed enron into the merger with dynegy , despite reservations from some enron executives about whether the deal was right . enron pledged some of its best assets to secure a $ 500 million investment from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup ' s citibank , and agreed to strict terms demanded by banks to get an emergency $ 1 billion credit line from various banks . in recent days , the two companies worked to restructure their merger and to raise still more liquidity for enron .
by 4 p . m . tuesday , the credit agencies agreed to hold off on a downgrade , convinced the two sides were making progress in restructuring the deal and drumming up new money for enron . in a conference call , ron barone , a managing director at s & p , told enron executives he was willing to wait on a decision , aware of the serious consequences of a downgrade .
"" we ' ll be very patient and diligent "" because of the progress being made , he told them , according to someone familiar with the conversation .
as late as 10 : 30 p . m . tuesday , a new deal still seemed in sight . but at about 2 a . m . yesterday , the talks broke down . instead of being briefed about terms of a new merger agreement , the credit - agency executives became doubtful a resolution would ever be reached .
in a late morning phone call to jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , mr . barone broke the news that the company ' s credit would be downgraded . "" we lost confidence the deal would be consummated in a way that would keep the rating intact , "" mr . barone says in an interview . "" enron ' s credibility and viability continued to diminish . they were aware of our concerns . ""
s & p downgraded enron ' s corporate - credit rating two full grades to single - b - minus , near the lower end of the junk - bond world , from triple - b - minus , the lowest investment - grade level . moody ' s lowered the debt to b 2 from baa 3 .
in a late - afternoon conference call with investors , s & p executives said the rating could still be lowered further , on the heels of the official announcement that the merger with dynegy was off .
responding to criticism that the credit agencies should have downgraded enron ' s debt sooner , mr . barone of s & p notes that the rating agency wasn ' t "" privy to everything . "" still , he adds , until yesterday "" we were confident it was an investment - grade company , and that the merger would give it the security to enable enron to function at an investment - grade level . ""
on the flip side , of course , if enron is forced into bankruptcy , the rating agencies may well catch heat that their impact was too drastic , effectively killing the deal .
treasurys
treasurys ended slightly higher . at 4 p . m . , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 1 / 32 point , or 31 cents per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 15 / 32 to yield 4 . 938 % . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price also was up 1 / 32 point , at 100 9 / 32 to yield 5 . 355 % .
the dow jones industrial average ended with a loss of 160 . 74 points . investors often shift funds to the relative safety of the government securities market at times when stocks are weak . a treasury sale of $ 21 billion of two - year notes drew less demand than expected . the bid - to - cover ratio , a gauge of demand comparing the dollar value of bids received with those awarded , was 1 . 51 , well below the 2 . 53 average of the past 12 auctions .
also somewhat bearish for the bond market was release of the fed ' s beige book report , an assessment of economic conditions around the country in advance of policy meetings . policy makers are to meet again dec . 11 .
although the report cited weakness in the economy , it didn ' t encourage people in the bond market to expect further rate cuts by the fed , analysts said . "" not everybody is in the camp that the fed ' s going to ease again , "" said kevin flanagan , market strategist at morgan stanley .

why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - energy trading bears the brunt of enron woes

less than a month ago , enron corp . ' s electronic trading system was the largest of its kind in the world , accounting for a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity delivered in the u . s .
yesterday , the system was shut down , a victim of enron ' s failed deal with dynegy inc .
while the rise and sudden fall of enron rippled throughout financial markets yesterday , nowhere was it more immediately evident than in energy trading , an arena utterly transformed by enron in recent years .
since the late 1990 s , enrononline had established itself as the dominant electronic energy marketplace - - and major competitor of the traditional futures exchanges - - as it grew to handle an average of 5 , 400 trades a day , with a value of about $ 2 . 8 billion .
but a flight away from enron began weeks ago , as initial news of the company ' s woes began to spread . because enron itself guaranteed trades on its platform , fears grew that the company might not be able to complete many of the transactions .
the exodus of trading activity from enrononline accelerated throughout the day yesterday , culminating in the system ' s shutdown around midday , when quotes on the system ' s internet trading screens simply went blank .
by 3 : 30 p . m . est , some trading had resumed in natural gas , though spokesman eric thode declined to say whether enron ' s markets would be open today . "" that ' s part of an evaluation that ' s ongoing , "" he said .
on the floor of the new york mercantile exchange , a traditional floor - based futures market , natural - gas trading volume almost doubled yesterday to 116 , 000 contracts . while enron ' s woes were the main driver behind the surge , the market also reacted to important storage data from the american gas association .
natural - gas prices jumped about 25 cents yesterday morning on an initial reaction to the enron news , near $ 3 per million british thermal units , then slipped back as the aga announced that gas storage had grown by 16 billion cubic feet to an all - time high . the nearby december contract fell 29 cents to $ 2 . 315 per million btus .
"" anyone who jumped into the gas market on the enron news is praying right now [ that prices recover ] , "" guy gleichmann , senior energy trader at barkely financial . "" it should only be a short - term factor in the market . ""
he said enron ' s collapse has helped gas prices because it is mainly seen as a threat to the overall gas supply . traders assume enrononline ' s problems won ' t affect actual energy deliveries , because whoever takes over enron ' s assets is expected to honor those commitments .
meantime , anticipating potential fallout from the enron problems , energy firms also have been reducing their financial risk in the energy markets by unwinding complex derivatives bets , either by hedging against them or taking delivery of the physical commodity .
in the future , those firms are likely to favor straightforward cash transactions for energy as a result of the enron meltdown . "" if anything , the enron situation has really simplified this market , "" mr . gleichmann said .
yesterday on the , enron ' s primary electronic rival , traders waited up to five minutes to log in , said jeff sprecher , the online market ' s chief executive .
he said it seemed most traders were just jockeying for position at first , assessing the newfound risk before actually making any trades . within the first 15 minutes after standard & poor ' s initial downgrade of enron , mr . sprecher said , the number of bids and offers on dropped by almost a third , to 2 , 200 .
"" by the end of the day , though , we expect this will probably be a record day for us , "" said mr . sprecher , who estimated the system ' s overall volume is up 45 % this month .
he expects much of that gain to be permanent on ice , although he cautioned that a loss of enrononline from the marketplace would have a downside , since its presence created opportunities to trade spreads between the two platforms .
nymex president j . robert collins warned it is still too early to declare enrononline dead . but he said its difficulties bode well for his exchange ' s internet - based system , dubbed enymex , now in development .
"" because of credit issues involving enron , companies might be more hesitant to trade there , "" he said . "" so we have a better shot with enymex than we did three or four months ago . ""
ronald j . barone , managing director for energy research at ubs warburg , said enrononline ' s value to prospective acquirers will drop quickly in coming days , if the business continues to decline .
"" dynegy really liked enrononline , but look at how much business the platform ' s been losing , "" said mr . barone , who downgraded enron ' s stock yesterday to a hold . "" there ' s also a question of how many more skeletons there are in the closet . ""
in commodity trading yesterday :
grains : futures prices on corn , wheat and soybeans all fell again at the chicago board of trade as what was described as a technical - based selloff accelerated . december - delivery corn futures sank to $ 1 . 9850 a bushel late in the session , which wiped out the old contract low . the contract ended up settling down five cents at $ 1 . 9875 a bushel .
crude oil : crude - oil futures slipped 26 cents to $ 19 . 22 a barrel after weekly inventory data showed a larger - than - expected five - million - barrel build in distillates supplies , which include heating oil . high refinery runs and imports were behind the build , analysts said . the contract might have fallen even more , except for a modest drop reported for crude - oil stocks .

for years , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay has been george w . bush ' s best friend in the board rooms of america ' s top corporations .

mr . lay was confident enough of his friendship with mr . bush that he even needled him for needing arthroscopic surgery to repair a jogging injury . "" i want you to know that at least one jogger [ me ] got past 50 without that surgery , "" mr . lay scribbled in a note to then governor in 1997 .
still , as enron faces its greatest crisis , mr . lay ' s influence and personal relationships with the administration have amounted to little . there appears to be no effort by the white house or congress to bail enron out of its difficulties , which are widely seen as self - inflicted . the white house had no comment on mr . lay ' s predicament , a spokeswoman said . indeed , short of an actual bailout to help enron meet its obligations - - such as an aid package approved by congress or organized by government officials from private sources , similar to the rescue of the long term capital management hedge fund - - there is little washington can do at this stage to help the company . nor is there likely to be a bailout , since enron has burned many bridges on capitol hill with its history of strong - arm lobbying tactics , some congressional aides say .
that may reassure a cynical public , says robert mosbacher , commerce secretary in the first bush administration and a longtime friend of the current president as well as mr . lay . "" i don ' t see anybody being let off the hook , "" he said .
mr . mosbacher says he introduced mr . lay to the bush family around 1987 , when he persuaded mr . lay to help raise money for george h . w . bush ' s successful presidential bid in 1988 . mr . lay contributed $ 461 , 000 to the younger mr . bush ' s two successful gubernatorial campaigns . he also made enron ' s fleet of corporate jets available to mr . bush and won his help in lobbying officials in other states considering enron projects .
his influence with then - gov . bush was based on more than money . mr . lay was one of the state ' s leading business executives and deeply involved in texas politics . under mr . bush ' s predecessor , democrat ann richards , mr . lay headed the governor ' s business council , a state advisory board . mr . bush asked him to stay on the job to help develop an educational reform plan and sell it to the texas legislature .
in that capacity , mr . lay became close to several bush aides , including political guru karl rove and communications adviser karen hughes , who have taken positions at the white house . he also got to know another leading texas businessman : dick cheney , then ceo of dallas oil concern halliburton co . , who would become mr . bush ' s pick for vice president .
against this backdrop , mr . lay was widely considered a top candidate for treasury secretary in the younger bush ' s administration . ultimately though , he was disqualified , bush insiders say , as too closely identified with mr . bush , mr . cheney and others who worked in the texas energy business for an administration that wanted to show it wasn ' t in the pocket of big oil companies .

dynegy and chevrontexaco slide along with plunge in enron stock

new york - - the collapse of enron dominated stock trading yesterday , as a host of the power generators and energy merchants exposed to the firm tumbled .
shares of dynegy , the suitor for enron that pulled out of a deal after debt - rating agencies lowered their ratings on enron ' s bonds , fell 4 . 92 , or 12 % , to 35 . 97 . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , slid 1 . 07 , or 1 . 2 % , to 84 . 55 .
shares of enron itself were ground down more than 85 % . the loss of $ 3 . 50 brought the closing price of each enron share down to 61 cents . this from a stock that , as recently as august 2000 , commanded more than $ 90 a share .
a host of other energy merchants , such as el paso , which lost 3 . 59 , or 7 . 4 % , to 44 . 91 , williams , which shed 1 . 80 , or 6 . 2 % , to 27 . 05 , and american electric power , which fell 2 . 03 , or 4 . 8 % , to 40 . 44 , all got caught in the backlash against the energy market .
the dow jones utility average finished the session down 8 . 48 points , a drop of 2 . 94 % , to 279 . 95 , which brought it down to a 52 - week low .
shares of two giant financial - services providers also got caught by their exposure to enron , and paid the price . shares of citigroup fell 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 % , to 47 . 80 , while j . p . morgan chase slid 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 % , to 37 . 50 .
with those two components in decline , the dow jones industrial average finished the session 160 . 74 points lower , a loss of 1 . 63 % , to 9711 . 86 . the nasdaq composite slid 2 . 48 % , or 48 points , to 1887 . 97 .
the dow industrial average ' s finish at 9711 . 86 represented the lowest close the average has posted in more than two weeks , since ending at 9554 . 37 . traders insisted that the speed and apparent ease with which market averages have managed to lard on gains over the past several weeks has stretched valuations , and left equities vulnerable to events , like the enron sell - off , that a sturdier market might have more handily absorbed .
"" one of the most important overriding factors has been the performance of the market itself , "" arthur hogan , chief market analyst at jefferies , said . "" the market has moved straight up seven weeks in a row , and when it moves up in a straight line like that , it doesn ' t take much in the way of a catalyst to tip it over . ""
whether it was excuse - making or profit - taking , the market did have to absorb some fundamental challenges in the session , including an especially pessimistic assessment of economic conditions from the federal reserve . the central bank released its beige book report on economic conditions , which showed , overall , the economy tilted more toward further slowing than it did toward recovery .
that helped further puncture shares of some of the retailers that got waylaid in tuesday ' s trading by a bearish consumer sentiment reading . shares of gap , stung by a reduction in its investment rating by prudential securities , lost 79 cents , or 5 . 5 % , to 13 . 61 . shares of another apparel retailer , american eagle outfitters , lost 1 . 3 , or 5 . 9 % , to 24 . 40 , while talbots dropped 1 . 25 , or 3 . 6 % , to 33 , and discounter kohl ' s fell 84 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 67 . 86 .
meanwhile , some of the classic cyclical stocks that have had good runs over the past several weeks as investors bet on an eventual economic recovery gave ground . shares of boeing fell 1 . 33 , or 3 . 7 % , to 34 . 17 , after j . p . morgan reduced its earnings forecasts for 2002 and 2003 . whirlpool lost 1 . 12 , or 1 . 7 % , to 64 . 98 . auto - parts maker eaton declined 1 , or 1 . 4 % , to 69 . 60 . general electric , also subject to some downbeat comments from j . p . morgan , fell 1 . 72 , or 39 . 35 .
continental airlines lost 2 . 40 , or 10 % , to 21 . 70 . the air carrier completed a public offering of 6 . 74 million shares of stock priced at $ 22 . 50 , a discount to tuesday ' s closing price of 24 . 10 .
coca - cola declined 1 . 06 , or 2 . 2 % , to 46 . 75 . j . p . morgan said it expects slower volume growth ahead for the beverage maker ' s bottlers . shares of coca - cola enterprises , coke ' s biggest bottler , eased 40 cents , or 2 . 3 % , to 17 .
magna international rose 1 . 54 , or 2 . 6 % , to 61 . 51 . salomon smith barney started coverage of the canadian auto - components maker with a buy rating .
medtronic gained 1 . 74 , or 4 % , to 45 . 78 . the minneapolis medical - device maker reported fiscal second - quarter results that matched wall street ' s projections , and said it expected to live up to third - quarter forecasts .
foot locker eased 19 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 15 . 70 , after mixed views from rival brokers . rbc capital markets started coverage of the stock with a strong buy rating , but jefferies reduced its coverage of the stock to accumulate from buy .

dollar declines against yen and euro amid growing doubts on u . s . economy

new york - - growing doubts about the u . s . economy ' s ability to rebound quickly from recession weighed heavily on the dollar , pushing the currency down almost a full yen and helping the euro regain some lost ground .
weakness in u . s . stocks - - due partly to news that dynegy inc . decided to walk away from its deal to buy enron corp . - - also put pressure on the dollar , while enron ' s debt woes added to general skittishness about the ability of u . s . business to bounce back quickly .
"" we know there are companies out there in trouble , "" said lara rhame , economist at brown brothers harriman in new york , who said that while the enron developments weren ' t having a direct impact on foreign - exchange markets , such reports do "" limit the kind of superdollar that we saw back in 1999 . ""
the dollar selloff kicked off in asian trading , when dealers used a standard & poor ' s downgrade of japan ' s sovereign rating as an excuse to buy the yen . the downgrade to double - a from double - a - plus was better than the market ' s expectations of a two - notch downgrade , rendering it good news of sorts .
the selling continued in new york trading , as traders continued to price in the possibility that they may have been far too optimistic about the dollar .
the two - pronged catalyst for this change of heart was the weak november consumer confidence index released tuesday , and subsequent gloomy comments from federal reserve governor laurence meyer pointing to more downside risks to the economy . the release of the federal reserve ' s beige book report yesterday served only to flame this pessimism .
the fed said that further slowing outweighed signs of recovery for the u . s . economy this autumn , noting that economic activity generally remained soft in october and the first half of november .
"" people wanted greater signs of recovery than they got from the fed , "" said alan ruskin , research director at the 4 cast financial consultancy in new york .
the beige book , a summary of economic activity prepared for use at the central bank ' s next federal open market committee meeting dec . 11 , is widely viewed as an indicator of future monetary policy decisions and the report helped to solidify expectations of a rate cut of at least a quarter percentage point .
late yesterday in new york , the euro was at 88 . 84 u . s . cents , its high for the session and up from 88 . 34 cents late tuesday in new york . the dollar was at 123 . 11 yen - - around its intraday low - - and almost a full yen down from 123 . 96 yen late tuesday in new york . the dollar was also at 1 . 6460 swiss francs , down from 1 . 6484 francs in london and 1 . 6560 francs tuesday . sterling was at $ 1 . 4261 , up from $ 1 . 4185 earlier in london and $ 1 . 4153 late tuesday .
elsewhere , the canadian dollar climbed to its highest levels in almost a month , confounding the view that bad news for the u . s . is bad news for canada .
the canadian currency has tended to suffer from an association with the u . s . , given that 85 % of canada ' s exports head south of the border . however , a 0 . 50 - percentage - point rate cut by the bank of canada on tuesday was quickly followed by the gloomy consumer confidence report in the u . s . , which undercut faith in the dollar and appeared to give the canadian unit just the opportunity it was seeking .
late in the new york day , the u . s . dollar was at c $ 1 . 5842 , down from c $ 1 . 5939 late tuesday .

enron ' s collapse : the overview
enron collapses as suitor cancels plans for merger

c . 2001 new york times company
enron , the champion of energy deregulation that grew into one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , collapsed yesterday , after a rival backed out of a deal to buy it and many big trading partners stopped doing business with it .
enron , based in houston , was widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection . with $ 62 billion in assets as of sept . 30 , it would be the biggest american company ever to go bankrupt , dwarfing the filing by texaco in 1987 . late in the day , though , enron ' s chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that the company was still talking to banks about a restructuring and considering other options .
talks with its would - be rescuer dynegy , also of houston , about salvaging the deal ended in acrimony .
dynegy , which had agreed on nov . 9 to buy enron but had second thoughts as enron disclosed more financial problems and investors pummeled its stock , accused enron of misrepresenting the health of its business . enron , meanwhile , was weighing whether to sue dynegy for breaching the terms of the deal , a person close to enron said .
enron ' s swift collapse left the prospects of 21 , 000 employees in doubt and wiped out what was left of the holdings of stock investors , including some big mutual funds , as shares that sold for $ 90 in august 2000 crashed to close yesterday at 61 cents . it roiled the treasury market and tarnished the standing of the big new york banks that both advised on the deal and poured their own cash into the company . and it left in tatters the reputation of enron ' s chief executive , kenneth l . lay , a confidant and campaign backer of president george w . bush . [ page cl . ]
the treasury department , the federal reserve and the federal energy regulatory commission said they had monitored enron ' s impact on the financial and energy markets yesterday ; officials who would comment said they saw no dangerous ripple effect .
' ' the markets are functioning normally , ' ' said peter bakstansky , a spokesman for the federal reserve bank of new york .
from a pipeline company in the 1980 ' s , enron grew into the world ' s largest energy trader , using the internet to buy and sell natural gas and electric power supplies for utilities and industrial power users and helping them hedge against fluctuations in power prices .
but enron was undone by shaky accounting , too much borrowed money and an unwillingness to provide information to investors who grew to doubt its financial reports .
five weeks ago , the company disclosed that , to fuel its growth , it had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its balance sheet and into an array of complex partnerships . the securities and exchange commission began an investigation , and enron restated five years of earnings , wiping out nearly $ 600 million in profit .
enron was teetering close to insolvency before dynegy , a smaller cross - town rival , agreed to acquire it for $ 9 billion plus the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt , with additional financing from chevrontexaco , a major dynegy shareholder .
but enron subsequently disclosed even more debts , and its financial plight continued to worsen . energy - trading companies reduced dealings with the firm ; doubting its creditworthiness , some forced enron to pay higher prices for natural gas and other products or required it to post large cash deposits to back trades .
for four days , enron and dynegy worked to salvage the deal . but yesterday morning , dynegy pulled out . ' ' we knew when to say no , and this morning , we said no , ' ' said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman .
in an interview , mr . watson said enron ' s energy - trading business had deteriorated . he also cited ' ' surprises ' ' in the quarterly report to the s . e . c . that enron filed on nov . 19 , including the disclosures that a credit downgrade meant enron had to pay or refinance a $ 690 million obligation and that enron had less cash on hand than dynegy had expected . ' ' confidence and credibility , which is what this business is all about , deteriorated after that , ' ' he said .
mr . watson said he called mr . lay yesterday after a meeting of dynegy ' s board to call off the deal . by then , s . dynegy shares fell $ 4 . 08 , or 10 percent , to close at $ 36 . 81 .
other big energy traders , like the el paso corporation , reliant energy , mirant and aquila , also fell . but enron ' s gradual decline over the last month gave many energy companies time to reduce their exposure to enron , and many operate rival trading operations that would benefit from its collapse .
yesterday morning , as news leaked out of dynegy ' s plans to cancel the deal and s . prices soar . dec . 15 2000 : four months after the chief executive of azurix resigns , enron takes the company private again . aug . 14 , 2001 : only six months after becoming chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling resigns . he is succeeded by kenneth l . lay . oct . 8 : four years after buying portland general electric , enron agrees to sell it to northwest natural gas oct . 16 : enron reports a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million . oct . 24 : two days after enron discloses that the securities and exchange commission is looking into complicated transactions involving enron and partnerships set up by andrew s . fastow , the company ' s chief financial officer , mr . fastow is forced out . oct . 31 : the s . e . c . upgrades its inquiry to a formal investigation . nov . 8 : enron discloses that it overstated profits for the previous five years by $ 586 million . nov . 9 : dynegy agrees to buy enron for about $ 9 billion . yesterday : the merger collapses . enron ' s stock falls $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents .

enron ' s collapse : the last resort
a bankruptcy filing might be the best remaining choice
by jonathan d . glater

c . 2001 new york times company
enron , facing the collapse of a deal with dynegy that might have rescued it from disaster and a tidal wave of debts suddenly coming due , may now have little choice but to enter bankruptcy , lawyers and analysts said yesterday .
filing for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code would give the company some much - needed breathing room to deal with creditors ' claims , as well as afford any eventual buyer the advantage of a court ' s approval .
but bankruptcy would also be complicated by the fact that some of enron ' s most valuable assets , including its transwestern pipeline linking texas natural gas fields with california energy markets , are already pledged to lenders . the value of other assets available to satisfy unsecured creditors is unclear .
still , enron ' s creditors will not necessarily lose everything , said robert j . rosenberg , a lawyer at latham any awards would not be paid until after creditors were satisfied . and like enron ' s other shareholders , they might end up with nothing , said robert d . albergotti , a partner at haynes & boone , a dallas law firm .
if enron files for bankruptcy , this is not likely to prevent litigation against arthur andersen , the company ' s outside auditor , said jeffrey n . gordon of columbia university law school . indeed , bankruptcy proceedings could give both the company and investors an opportunity to figure out exactly how its profits came to be overstated and to look for potential fraud .
a special committee of enron ' s board has already retained deloitte & touche , another big accounting firm , to help .
' ' it ' s going to be a while before they figure it all out , ' ' professor gordon said .

an implosion on wall street

enron , the energy - trading company , may be on the verge of extinction with the collapse yesterday of its proposed acquisition by dynegy , a smaller competitor , and the downgrading of its debt to junk status . but its name has attained immortality on wall street .
enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm . take a high - flying company terribly impressed with its sense of unique mission and ingenuity , and correspondingly contemptuous of its obligations to fully comply with the spirit of accounting rules . then add fawning investors , wall street analysts , journalists and accountants unwilling to allow a company ' s lack of transparency about its business to get in the way of a dizzying ride , until they realize the destination is the top of a steep cliff . what you have then is an enron .
there have been plenty of other once - unfathomable implosions on wall street , but perhaps none so sudden or of such magnitude . jittery financial markets now have to contend with the possibility that an enron bankruptcy could undermine the financial health of banks and other energy companies . enron ranked seventh on the list of fortune 500 companies last year , and remained one of the most hyped stories on wall street well into this year . a pioneer in creating private marketplaces for newly deregulated commodities , enron was touted as a revolutionary force , bridging the dot - com world and stodgy energy markets .
now enron may become one of the largest bankruptcy cases in history . its stock closed yesterday at 61 cents , as investors rushed for the exits in reaction to the fatal news that , without a bailout from dynegy , enron is unlikely to be able to meet its crushing debt obligations .
the company ' s autopsy will be a complicated affair , entailing numerous lawsuits . what is already clear , and will come as a shock to millions of trusting individual investors across america , is that the financials of a fortune 500 company were essentially a mystery . enron ' s death watch began last month when it grudgingly disclosed that $ 1 . 2 billion of its market value had vanished as a result of ' ' related - party ' ' transactions with private partnerships that enriched company insiders . then enron admitted that it had overstated its profits over the last five years by $ 600 million . dynegy cited enron ' s lack of forthrightness as a reason to walk away from the merger agreement .
not very long ago , competitors and democrats in washington were worrying whether the close ties between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and george w . bush would give the company too much influence . enron has aggressively lobbied , with some success in recent years , to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations .
now enron is the best argument for the need for stronger supervision of public companies ' financial data . the securities and exchange commission should make sure that the energy trader ' s saga puts an end to any talk of lessening disclosure requirements faced by public companies . moreover , arthur andersen ' s failure to uncover flawed accounting by enron , or to forcefully question some of the company ' s shadier transactions , raises serious concerns about auditors ' commitment to be sufficiently diligent in reviewing the actions of major companies .
there is a certain irony that enron , a champion of deregulation , now becomes a poster child for the need for strong regulation on wall street .

enron ' s collapse : the lenders
citigroup and j . p . morgan are left with bruised egos and exposure to loans

dynegy ' s decision to walk away from enron leaves citigroup and j . p . morgan chase licking their wounds after an effort to burnish their reputations as deal makers .
as lead advisers and lead bankers for enron , the banks had the chance to build influence in the merger business . unlike other wall street firms , citigroup and j . p . morgan have large balance sheets and have boasted of their ability to provide both loans and advice . j . p . morgan , in particular , ' ' has been saying that providing financing is an advantage they have in terms of building their investment banking franchise , ' ' said richard strauss , a goldman , sachs analyst following brokerage firms .
now , not only have the banks lost bragging rights for pulling off a difficult deal , as well as millions in fees , they are also left holding hundreds of millions in loans to enron , which is trying to stave off bankruptcy . enron owes the two banks anywhere from $ 800 million to $ 900 million each , although some of it may be hedged through derivatives contracts , analysts estimated .
in bankruptcy , of course , creditors come well ahead of shareholders , who have now been virtually wiped out . janus capital was the biggest shareholder for most of the year , but alliance capital surpassed it as of sept . 30 , according to the latest regulatory filing available . enron ' s stock plunged to 61 cents yesterday .
worries about the money enron owes the banks punished their stocks yesterday . citigroup ' s shares closed at $ 47 . 80 each , down $ 2 . 75 , while j . p . morgan fell $ 2 . 30 , to $ 37 . 50 .
even if enron files for bankruptcy , neither j . p . morgan nor citigroup is thought to have enough exposure to be at serious risk . executives of the banks declined to comment on the estimates of their exposure . while the banks had each promised to make equity investments in the companies of $ 250 million each , those investments have been canceled along with the dynegy deal .
about half of the money owed to j . p . morgan and citigroup consists of a $ 1 billion loan the banks made earlier this month that is secured by one of enron ' s pipelines . citigroup lent $ 600 million , and j . p . morgan provided the rest , according to an executive close to the enron negotiations . the remainder owed to the banks is in various loans , trading positions and other investments not secured by enron assets .
given that there are assets backing much of the banks ' loans , some analysts said the stock market had overreacted . ' ' the net exposure could be very small , ' ' said andrew collins , who covers bank stocks at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray and is recommending citigroup and j . p . morgan .
jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said the company was still working with j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to restructure enron ' s debts .
several other banks may own large amounts of enron debt . bank of america has $ 200 million to $ 300 million , according to estimates by lori appelbaum , who follows bank stocks for goldman , sachs , and ruchi madan , a stock analyst at salomon smith barney . other banks identified by the analysts as owed money are the bank of new york , bank one , fleetboston financial , suntrust and the wachovia corporation . a spokesman for suntrust did not return calls ; executives at the other banks declined to comment .
in what appears to have been bad timing , alliance capital management , a subsidiary of axa , increased its stake in enron late this summer . janus , a unit of stilwell financial , had been the biggest shareholder , but was pruning its stake . alliance ' s position grew 71 percent in the report filed in september , to 5 . 8 percent of enron ' s outstanding . jane ingalls , a spokeswoman for janus , said last night that janus had since sold all its shares , but did not say when or at what price . a spokesman for alliance would not comment about its stake in enron .

enron ' s collapse : the market
in turbulent bond market , enron ' s woes exacerbate turmoil

the swift downfall of enron has contributed to extreme turbulence in the united states treasury market in recent weeks , causing violent swings in interest rates not seen since russia defaulted on its debt and the long - term capital management hedge fund nearly collapsed in late 1998 .
even though the exact makeup of enron ' s large trading portfolio remains a mystery , traders said that the energy company had bet that interest rates would continue to decline because of continuing weakness in the economy .
then two weeks ago , the economy began to show signs of revival . as investors decided that the days of federal reserve rate cuts were over , rates began to rise and prices on treasury securities fell . the move out of treasuries crushed traders who still expected the weak economy to push interest rates lower . scrambling to cut their losses , those traders sold even more , depressing prices and pushing up rates further .
the sense among many market participants is that enron ' s woes made a bad market excruciating . ' ' i think the street in general lost half of its year or more in the last week or two , ' ' said stan jonas , managing director at fimat usa , a broker dealer . ' ' everyone was long the bond market , thinking the economy was going to be bad . then everything shifted , and enron drove it to extremes . ' '
how extreme ? in the two weeks beginning nov . 12 , two - year treasury notes plummeted in price , pushing their yields up to 3 . 18 percent , from 2 . 41 percent . in the same period , yields on treasuries with five - year maturities went to 4 . 4 percent , from 3 . 62 percent .
the trade that appears to have gone awry for enron , market participants say , involved the sale of hundreds of thousands of eurodollar futures , some of which matured in two or three years . such contracts are frequently used to bet on the direction of interest rates . enron could also have used the eurodollar contracts to hedge against fluctuations in oil prices . in a weak economy , oil prices usually fall . but so do interest rates , so a bet on lower rates would produce gains to help offset the decline in oil prices . when data showed signs of life in the economy , traders surmised that enron began to sell its eurodollars and started an avalanche of selling among other traders .
there were huge eurodollar positions being liquidated , said gemma wright , director of market strategy at barclays capital . ' ' we don ' t know for certain who it was , but the amount of the loss was high . ' '
one reason that traders suspect enron may have been forced out of such a position was that the company had neither the cash flow nor the bank credit to meet calls for additional cash from traders at other firms . typically , companies have cash reserves to meet such calls or have access to temporary lines of credit to cover shortfalls . enron appears to have neither . yesterday , the company said it was suspending all payments except for those ' ' necessary to maintain core operations . ' '
in addition to the recent interest rate spike , enron has had to contend with falling oil prices . the price of crude oil has dropped 28 percent since the end of october .
caught in a vise , enron has almost certainly been selling securities to raise cash . treasury securities and eurodollar contracts , because their markets are large , are among the easiest to sell . in both cases , enron was probably selling into a falling market .
adding to the turmoil in the bond market , traders said , was less participation by wall street firms , which were unwilling to take on big new trading positions near the end of their fiscal year . several firms end their years on nov . 30 .
some traders say enron ' s problems started with comments on tuesday by laurence h . meyer , a governor of the federal reserve . mr . meyer suggested that additional rate cuts might be coming , and that remark helped stabilize prices of treasury securities . ' ' it ' s my view that there are no coincidences , ' ' mr . jonas said . ' ' laurence meyer is a big hawk on interest rates , and he basically talked a 180 . that was their big gun . the only bigger gun would have been greenspan . ' '

enron ' s collapse : market place
a big fall evoking nasty old memories of a run on a bank
by floyd norris
11 / 29 / 2001
the new york times
page 1 , column 1
c . 2001 new york times company
the final collapse of enron amounted to something that few living americans have ever seen : a bank run like those in the days before deposit insurance .
enron appeared to become a wildly successful company by creating a new , largely unregulated financial business , that of energy trading . that business ran on credit , and required suppliers and users of energy to sign contracts that called on enron to meet obligations months or years later .
enron became something like a bank , which takes depositors ' money and promises to pay it back later . but unlike banks in the current era , this institution had no federal deposit insurance to reassure customers when rumors began to spread that it was in trouble . that proved to be its achilles ' heel . enron ' s collapse is a reminder for big players in unregulated markets that their financial health must be beyond doubt .
before the advent of deposit insurance , bankers knew what was needed to head off a bank run . it was cash , so much cash that it would be clear that panic was unwarranted . nearly a century ago , j . p . morgan took the lead as he and fellow banking tycoons put up the millions needed to keep the trust company of america open . thus was halted the panic of 1907 .
as it happened , corporate descendants of two major institutions involved in that rescue - - j . p . morgan chase and citigroup - - were major players in the enron debacle . but they did not try the strategy this time .
instead , enron kept arranging an additional billion or two in loans , clearly struggling to find the money . morgan and citigroup allowed the word to spread that they were ready to put in more money on their own , but the amounts were relatively small , and somehow the money was never invested .
when dynegy agreed to buy enron , it put up $ 1 . 5 billion in cash only after it was assured that it would get control of the company ' s crown jewel , the northern natural gas pipeline system , or its money back , if the deal collapsed .
the final straw came on tuesday , when negotiations on a revised dynegy takeover deal came down to efforts to find $ 250 million or $ 500 million of enron assets that could serve as collateral for a new dynegy cash advance . the message to companies that traded with enron was clear : even its rescuer is demanding collateral , and is having trouble finding it .
given that , enron ' s financial business could not continue . public haggling over the terms of the rescue assured that no rescue was possible , something that would have been obvious to the original j . p . morgan but that seemed to escape his corporate heirs . as walter bagehot , the british financial journalist and historian , wrote in 1873 , ' ' every banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit , however good may be his arguments , in fact his credit is gone . ' '
the markets enron helped to create will endure , but probably without enron . it will be interesting to see whether participants in them continue to resist regulation as much as they have in the past . unregulated markets , especially when they are relatively new , can be very profitable for those with superior market knowledge , as enron seemed to have . but when prices are visible to all , the value of that knowledge plummets . regulation could bring more openness , but it could also bring structures , like clearing systems , that reassure traders they need not worry about the credit of those with whom they trade .
if the markets continue to be unregulated , enron ' s collapse makes it more likely that the big players in those markets will be companies that are already regulated enough to assure customers that they are secure - - companies like major banks and brokerage houses . that would be bad news for dynegy , which was enron ' s major competitor before it tried to become its acquirer .
the crisis at enron may have exposed a ' ' flaw in the business model ' ' of energy trading companies , said john diaz , a managing director at moody ' s , in an interview yesterday . ' ' companies in this industry need to think carefully about their liquidity management , ' ' he said . ' ' we ' re going to be looking very hard at this . ' '
the litigation over enron seems likely to be prolonged and expensive , but it may boil down to senator howard h . baker jr . ' s famous watergate - era question about president richard m . nixon : what did he know and when did he know it ?
that question will be asked about arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , and about its corporate officials , past and present . but it will be asked most particularly about the banks and investment banks that served enron and its affiliated off - balance - sheet entities in recent years .
enron ' s disclosures last week showed it needed to pay far more in debts over the next year than most people had understood to be the case . but the newly discovered loans did not materialize out of thin air . the money was lent by banks and bond buyers to the off - balance - sheet entities . those who were stuck with losses on the known enron debt may claim the financiers who syndicated the loans should have told them of all the other debt .
among those who do not come out of this looking very good are the bond rating agencies . just six weeks ago , after enron put out an earnings release showing strong pro - forma profits , as it defined them , two of the agencies , fitch and standard & poor ' s , reaffirmed enron ' s rating of triple - b plus . moody ' s , the agency that was the most skeptical about enron , put the rating under review and hinted it would , at worst , cut it one notch .
none of the rating agencies seemed overly concerned about a detail disclosed by enron at the time : a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to what it later said were accounting mistakes involving a partnership run by enron ' s chief financial officer . but that disclosure set off a cascade of questions that enron could not answer in a reassuring way . it ran through billions as companies demanded more protection to keep trading with it .
enron could have been saved , if an institution that was trusted - - whether that was chevron texaco , which put up the $ 1 . 5 billion cash that dynegy invested , or j . p . morgan chase or citigroup - - had made it clear that it was willing to stand behind enron . a credible backer would have ended the run .
but no one was willing to do that , and their hesitance as they learned more only accelerated the run . whether they were wise to avoid that exposure may become clear as it emerges how much creditors will eventually get .
finally , the rating agencies yesterday downgraded enron to relatively low levels of junk . they knew that was likely to force enron into bankruptcy in the near future , but they also knew that no one was willing to rescue a company that the agencies had viewed as solid only weeks before .
yesterday , as dynegy walked away from the merger , it said that it was no longer willing to trade with enron - - unless enron put up ' ' sufficient credit support . ' ' it knew that support was nowhere to be found .

enron ' s collapse : the chief executive
foundation gives way on chief ' s big dream

well before anyone could imagine that enron might collapse , kenneth l . lay was stumped . in an interview in august , he dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy company ' s annual report that hinted at bigger problems if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels .
' ' i just can ' t help you on that , ' ' he said . pressed further on questions about a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved enron ' s former chief financial officer , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '
at the least , mr . lay - - a man of big ideas , a crusader for free markets , a risk taker in the texas wildcatter tradition - - had taken his eye off the ball . while he was busy befriending the nation ' s most powerful politicians , erecting one of the tallest buildings in houston and pasting enron ' s logo on the city ' s new ballpark , the little things were turning out to be mr . lay ' s big problems .
one after another , disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month : the partnerships had hidden billions in debt ; years of enron ' s reported profits had been exaggerated ; the government was investigating . rivals were shunning enron ' s energy trading desks , which mr . lay had built into the world ' s leaders . and sure enough , the stock price tumbled day after day , and credit agencies lowered enron ' s ratings once and then yesterday again , turning the company ' s debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock .
three weeks ago , mr . lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to dynegy , his houston rival . yesterday , dynegy pulled out of the deal . deprived of enough information , and then repelled by what they learned , the free markets in which mr . lay had put so much faith all but destroyed , in a matter of weeks , everything he had built .
' ' if they had been going a slower speed , the results would not have been disastrous , ' ' said bob mcnair , a houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to enron three years ago . but enron , he said in an interview this month , was like a race car , and the markets like an unforgiving track . ' ' it ' s a lot harder to keep it on the track at 200 miles per hour , ' ' he said . ' ' you hit a bump and you ' re off the track . ' '
from his youth , mr . lay , 59 , had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets ' wisdom . he studied economics at the university of missouri , living at home to save on room and board , and eventually earned a ph . d . in the subject . as a naval officer serving in the pentagon , he worked to develop more efficient accounting systems . later , he served as an aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas industry - - a market that enron would come to dominate .
moving into the private sector , he worked his way up the ranks of the natural gas industry , becoming chief executive in 1984 of the houston natural gas corporation , a big regional pipeline operator . he engineered its merger with internorth , an omaha pipeline company , and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to enron .
mr . lay saw enron ' s mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel . at the time , gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passive role ; buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly . but as oil prices plunged in the mid - 80 ' s and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil , mr . lay returned to washington to argue , successfully , for rules changes that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities .
the new flexibility brought the threat of chaos , however , as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly . that is when the new enron was truly born . to help customers shield themselves from risk , mr . lay ' s enron developed hedging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper and winter wheat . its innovative ' ' gas bank ' ' let utilities lock up the long - term prices that they craved ; enron lined up the gas supplies from producers , arranged for delivery - - and took a cut of every deal .
that business became the forerunner of enron ' s entry into hundreds of other markets , helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric power to pulp and paper and , most recently , fast broadband access to the internet . trading soon provided more of the company ' s profits than the traditional natural gas business .
while other companies , including dynegy , focused on accumulating hard assets like pipelines , turbines and gas fields , enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading company with an almost limitless future .
' ' there is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corporation in the world , ' ' mr . lay ' s handpicked successor as enron ' s chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , told the authors of a book , just published , about business on the internet . even the book ' s title , ' ' radical e : from ge to enron - - lessons on how to rule the web ' ' ( ) , showed the cachet the company had attained . enron , the authors wrote , was ' ' creating a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and rewarded . ' '
mr . skilling abruptly resigned in august , after just six months on the job , propelling mr . lay back into the gritty details of enron ' s businesses that he had sought to leave to others .
as the company grew , he had become increasingly involved in public affairs , serving as host when a global economic conference was held in houston in 1990 and when the republican national convention came to the city in 1992 .
like the leaders of many big texas businesses - - the construction colossus brown became good friends with the texas governor , ann richards ; and supported senator phil gramm of texas , whose wife , wendy , a former chairwoman of the commodities futures trading commission , joined enron ' s board .
' ' he ' s a stand - up guy , ' ' said ms . richards , now a business consultant in new york . asked to be more specific , she said , ' ' he ' s at the meeting ' ' - - meaning she could count on mr . lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked him to do , and not just sign onto a project for show .
mr . lay ' s deepest political ties were with the bush family . in the 1980 ' s , he became a major fund - raiser for george h . w . bush . when mr . bush lost his 1992 campaign for re - election as president , mr . lay brought a number of senior bush aides to enron as directors or consultants , including james a . baker iii , the former secretary of state , and robert a . mosbacher , the former secretary of commerce .
mr . lay also cultivated mr . bush ' s son george w . long before he was considered a serious national candidate . after the younger mr . bush ' s election as texas governor in 1994 , mr . lay became head of the governor ' s business council , an important advisory post .
the bond with president bush is personal . as governor , mr . bush sent mr . lay a kidding note in 1997 . ' ' one of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older - - just like you ! ' ' he wrote . ' ' 55 years old . wow ! that is really old . thank goodness you have such a young , beautiful wife , ' ' he added , a reference to mr . lay ' s wife , linda .
in 1999 , mr . lay sent a handwritten christmas note to mr . bush and his wife , laura . ' ' linda and i are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the white house , ' ' he wrote .
yesterday , the white house press secretary , ari fleischer , said the treasury department was monitoring enron ' s downfall for its effect on the market . asked if the president himself had any reaction , mr . fleisher said , ' ' the president ' s reaction is that it should be monitored . ' '
in some ways , enron ' s collapse was one more example of the bursting of the internet bubble . but mr . lay was not some stylish dot - com brat ; by all accounts , he is an immensely likable product of middle america . growing up in tiny rush hill , mo . , he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting away savings . by 16 , his sister sharon recalled this week , ' ' he was bucking bales ' ' - - that is , loading hay - - ' ' and had two jobs in the summer , painting houses . ' '
' ' i don ' t think you could ever say that he did something the easy way , ' ' she said .
that work ethic ran in the family . mr . lay ' s father was a minister who also sold farm equipment . the family ' s finances were spotty , ' ' at times no money , at times some money , ' ' ms . lay recalled . still , the lays took in people from their church who were in need .
over the last decade or so , mr . lay earned some $ 300 million from enron , mostly by exercising stock options . earlier this month , when employees grew incensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the company ' s sale to dynegy , he volunteered to walk away from $ 60 million in payments .
mr . mcnair , the houston entrepreneur , who has known mr . lay for years , suggested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him . ' ' maybe the people who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear , but they weren ' t telling him everything , ' ' he said .
mr . mcnair said he spoke to mr . lay recently and found him ' ' somewhat in a state of shock . ' ' mr . mcnair added , ' ' he ' s devastated . ' '
in the end , it seems , the man whose company did so much to help others manage their risk could not manage his own .

enron ' s collapse : the derivatives
market that deals in risks faces a novel one

when members of the international swaps and derivatives association gathered in washington last april , the man they all wanted to hear was jeffrey k . skilling , then the president and chief executive of enron .
enron had helped create the global market for energy - based derivatives - - customized risk - swapping contracts that enable companies to hedge their exposure to changing energy prices and supply fluctuations . even among traders more familiar with interest - rate swaps or currency hedges than energy contracts , mr . skilling ' s presentation did not disappoint .
' ' he dazzled everybody - - it seemed he could figure out a way to trade the minutes on this phone call , ' ' one industry executive said .
but yesterday , many of those same executives were crossing their fingers and hoping that enron ' s crisis would not spread into the energy swaps market that the company had done so much to enliven .
as the day ended with fairly stable trading , there were a few cautious sighs of relief . but nobody is quite sure just how much money the energy - related derivatives markets will have at risk if enron fails .
according to swaps monitor publications , which collects data for the derivatives markets , enron ranks among the top energy - swaps traders in the world , on a par with financial giants like bank of america and barclay ' s .
at the end of september , enron ' s gross derivatives trading liabilities - - the amount of money it would owe to other market players if it filed for bankruptcy - - stood at $ 18 . 7 billion , up slightly from june levels but about $ 1 . 3 billion less than at the end of last year .
but that level may overstate the risk to other companies . ' ' these numbers do not take into account the unknown amount of collateral that enron may have posted , ' ' said paul spraos , swaps monitor ' s president . such collateral should , in principle , diminish enron ' s actual liabilities to the derivatives market , he said .
in a typical energy swap , a company will enter into a contract to lock in a fixed price of a certain commodity , like natural gas or electricity . the other company , the counterparty , in the deal assumes the risk of future price changes and quotes a fixed price that includes its own profit . the efficient trading and pricing of these contracts requires a marketplace with large , active traders .
as of last night , there were no signs of a major panic that would drive major participants to the sidelines , industry executives said .
' ' it ' s not likely that enron ' s problems will cause serious difficulty for any other sizable counterparty , ' ' said mark c . brickell , a veteran swaps - market executive and the chief executive of blackbird , a technology firm that operates an electronic swaps - trading system . ' ' while there may be some smaller firm that didn ' t manage its exposure as well as it might , that won ' t cause any major problems for the system as a whole . ' '
michael williams , managing director of tradespark , a rival to enron ' s online energy - trading system , agreed that there was ' ' no sign of shrinkage ' ' in the marketplace yesterday . ' ' so far , we ' ve seen no complaints about a lack of liquidity , ' ' he added .
most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contract that was developed by the international swaps and derivatives association and is recognized in the courts . the contract clearly specifies the rights each party has in the event of a default , said robert pickel , the association ' s chief executive . as of late yesterday , he added , the markets appeared ' ' to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments regarding such a major player . ' '
but at least one lawyer who specializes in swaps contracts indicated that it might be too soon to assess the full impact . that lawyer , ann o ' hara , in lincoln , neb . , said that her clients ' anxiety about enron had escalated sharply only in the last few days . ' ' no one believed it would really happen , ' ' she said . ' ' it is not a surprise , but it is a shock . ' '
' ' we don ' t really know who is out there exposed to enron ' s credit , ' ' she added . ' ' i ' m telling my clients to prepare for the worst . ' '

enron ' s collapse : the rating agencies
debt rankings finally fizzle , but the deal fizzled first
by alex berenson

c . 2001 new york times company
in the end , the rating agencies hardly mattered .
for weeks , wall street wondered whether moody ' s investors service , standard & poor ' s and fitch ' s , the three major agencies rating corporate debt , would drop enron ' s rating below investment grade .
enron and dynegy warned that cutting the rating might jeopardize dynegy ' s acquisition of enron . executives at big securities firms that stood to profit from the deal pressed moody ' s to keep ratings at investment grade , even as enron bonds fell to levels indicating that the debt was highly risky .
but even an investment - grade rating could not save enron ' s business from collapse over the last month . after a series of damaging revelations about enron ' s finances , the company ' s partners demanded extra capital for its trades or stopped trading with it . by the time the rating agencies decided yesterday that enron might well default on its debt , dynegy had decided on its own to walk away .
' ' it wasn ' t really the reason that dynegy backed out of the deal , ' ' said todd shipman , the standard & poor ' s analyst who was the first to cut enron ' s rating yesterday .
the cuts dim the hopes enron had of avoiding bankruptcy . all three agencies slashed enron ' s debt far below investment grade . moody ' s cut enron ' s rating 5 notches , standard & poor ' s lowered it 6 , and fitch slashed it 10 , to cc , its third - lowest grade .
' ' default is a probability , ' ' said glen grabelsky , the senior director of credit policy for fitch . enron has $ 13 billion in debt outstanding and about $ 10 billion more in loans , made by partnerships , that the company has guaranteed .
the aggressive rating cuts may not mollify the investors who have sharply criticized the agencies for being slow to act in recent weeks . officials at all three agencies defended themselves yesterday , saying they had acted prudently .
after dynegy agreed to buy enron , moody ' s tried to calculate the chances that the deal would go through , that enron would remain strong until it was completed and that the combined company would carry a strong rating , said john diaz , managing director for moody ' s power and energy group .
at first , those questions seemed to have reassuring answers , mr . diaz said , so moody ' s kept enron ' s investment - grade rating .
but in recent days , other companies have shied away from doing business with enron , and its losses have soared . ' ' basic cash flow was slowing down at the same time that the cost structure of the company was the same , ' ' mr . diaz said . enron ' s mounting losses discouraged dynegy , he said .
' ' over the last 24 hours , the probability that we ' ve assigned to these three key issues was looking to be a lot smaller , ' ' mr . diaz said .
mr . grabelsky said the acquisition uncertainty presented the agencies with a situation where enron ' s debt could be very strong , if the deal worked , or highly risky .
' ' there is no middle ground , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s one or the other . ' '

although these are just single - digit positions , a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent holding could trim off half of a fund ' s return , said scott berry , morningstar bond fund analyst .
the average intermediate bond fund has returned 7 . 3 per cent so far this year , according to morningstar . a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent stake could reduce a 7 . 3 per cent return to roughly 3 . 3 per cent , mr berry said .
"" with bonds , there ' s much more downside than upside . typically , the downside is never realised because these investment - grade bonds are strong enough to weather the storm , but enron just caught everybody by surprise over the last couple of months , "" he said .
other large investment - grade bond funds that held enron ' s debt as of their most recent filings include the $ 13 . 6 bn fidelity short term bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent , worth $ 27 . 7 m as of april 30 , and two of the strong funds - the $ 1 . 36 m strong corporate bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent as of september 30 , or $ 10 . 5 m , and the $ 1 . 43 bn strong short term bond fund , with a 0 . 63 per cent holding , also as of september 30 , worth $ 9 m .
mr berry said managers of investment - grade bond funds that still held the debt were probably selling it , although most had the latitude to hold a bond once it lost its investment - grade status . however , they also said junk - bond fund managers were unlikely to buy it , because other "" fallen angel "" bonds such as xerox had not performed well .

companies & finance the americas - sec filing triggered merger crisis .

dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron went into "" crisis mode "" 10 days ago , said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive .
in a filing to the sec , enron revealed a previously undisclosed $ 690 m note payment due this week , as well as that it had $ 9 . 15 bn in debt due by the end of next year . the news provoked another round of selling in enron ' s already plunging share price , forcing dynegy into 18 - hour a day talks that ran through the thanksgiving weekend and up to midnight on tuesday . .
"" that may have been the last straw to some shareholders , "" mr watson said just hours after withdrawing from dynegy ' s $ 9 bn merger with enron . enron had been the biggest energy trader in the us until a crisis of confidence , beginning in october , that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .
"" every time we thought we had the pieces , "" he said . "" every time we put the puzzle together it wasn ' t a clear strategy to go forward . ""
he said the talks resumed yesterday at 7 am , but when the rating agencies began downgrading enron to junk status , mr watson called ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , to say "" it wasn ' t going to work "" .
"" once they downgraded the company , we thought , what was already an uphill battle , was too difficult , "" he said . mr watson said he offered to help any way he could and the two men - who have long been friendly , cross - town rivals - parted amicably .
mr watson has received several calls from other counter - parties in the business , thanking him for saving them from a meltdown by giving them the time to limit their exposure to enron . "" i don ' t feel like a saviour , i feel tired , "" he said . but he acknowledged he provided a vast number of enron ' s counterparties , partners and customers a chance to better protect themselves against enron ' s demise .
"" there was a really strong effort to make it happen , "" he said . "" in the end , we couldn ' t find a solution that didn ' t risk dynegy ' s responsibility to its shareholders and to its employees . ""
he says the merger agreement allows it to walk away with enron ' s most valuable asset , the northern natural gas pipeline , though if enron disputes that , at worst , it would leave with money invested in saving enron . "" we are as solid as we were going into ( the merger ) and , maybe , better for the experience , "" he said .

companies & finance the americas - financial system braces for a chain reaction .

gary silverman .
enron ' s woes are raising risks for the financial system , threatening to set off a chain reaction in the markets that could damage any number of participants in unforeseen ways .
individual banks could lose hundreds of millions of dollars apiece on loans to enron , but regulators are confident the lenders have sufficient capital to weather such a storm .
the bigger worry is that enron ' s difficulties could trigger ripple effects in much the same way as russia ' s default in 1998 destabilised the long - term capital management hedge fund .
prices for banking stocks tumbled yesterday in new york and london , in large part because no one really knows what would happen if enron were removed from the financial scene .
enron sat on a massive trading book , made up of complex derivatives transactions , some meant to stay in place for decades . on the other side were a host of counterparties , many of them energy companies that are not supervised by banking regulators .
the counterparties , in turn , have their own set of borrowing and trading relationships with banks that may be completely unaware of their customers ' ties to enron . bankers also fear that because so many of these counterparties were new to sophisticated trading , they may have been lax in collateralising their deals .
for leading banks , enron ' s woes could result in big hits to profits . just about every big lending bank has exposure to enron , according to members of the bank group .
at a meeting of enron ' s creditors last week , one banker estimated there could have been 500 bankers representing 20 or more banks .
jp morgan chase and citigroup are the most prominent members of the bank group , but barclays , credit lyonnais , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank and many others are exposed .
it was understood that jp morgan chase ' s direct exposure to enron approaches $ 900 m , about $ 500 m of it unsecured by the energy company ' s assets . citigroup ' s direct exposure could reach $ 800 m , about half unsecured .
european banks also could take hits . according to data from loanware , for example , westlb , the german state - owned bank , has a $ 580 m bridge facility outstanding . this was extended as trade financing last year and does not appear to have been syndicated .
however , analysts caution that determining the exposure of a particular bank to enron is virtually impossible for outsiders . many loans are syndicated or sold , and bankers are also making increasing use of credit derivatives that enable them to buy insurance against default from counterparties .
barclays , for example , is one of the most active arrangers of finance for enron but it has syndicated most of its initial exposure . its exposure is estimated at less than # 250 m ( $ 356 m ) . on the other hand , banks could be exposed to firms that dealt with enron , which sold credit default insurance to its trading partners , according to market participants .
investors rerated banking stocks yesterday to account for expected exposures . citigroup was down $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 per cent , to $ 47 . 80 , while jp morgan was down $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 78 per cent , to $ 37 . 50 . in london , shares in barclays fell 4 per cent , or 86 p , to 2093 p . additional reporting by joshua chaffin in new york and rebecca bream in london .

companies & finance the americas - traders avoid exposure to junk status fallout .

energy traders on both sides of the atlantic were doing very little business with enron even before credit rating agencies demoted the debt of the world ' s biggest power trader to junk status .
rivals have been anxiously calculating their potential exposure to an enron collapse for at least a month - since the true extent of the company ' s crisis emerged .
most traders before yesterday were only prepared to be buyers of electricity and gas from the group , on the basis that it was better to owe than be owed in these circumstances .
"" there would have been very few sellers to enron , "" said one trader last night .
the group accounts for about 25 per cent of energy trading in the us with a similar market share in the smaller european market .
the loss of such a large player could cause liquidity problems in the us , said one analyst .
europe - based energy groups , however , felt there was sufficient capacity in their market to fill the gap .
more worrying is the knock - on effect particularly on smaller companies should enron be unable to honour long - term contracts , said brian senior , director of trading and asset management at innogy , the uk arm of the demerged national power .
the collapse of enron ' s credit rating means that it may have to provide a lot of cash as collateral to cover long - term liabilities , with money being due as early as next monday , said mr senior .
most large energy groups stopped trading with enron in european markets two days ago .
"" the simplest thing is to pull the plug until they ' ve figured out what ' s going on , "" said one analyst .
martin stanley , president of european energy trading for txu , another large us energy group , said : "" we have halted trading with enron . we are sorry to see it happen because they are a very innovative company . ""
even before yesterday ' s events , txu , like other large traders , had been adding up how much it could be owed and how much it would owe , should enron fail to honour its obligations .
"" we have been looking at various scenarios and have implemented our credit event management process designed to minimise our cash exposure , "" said mr stanley .
"" we are comfortable with our cash position , "" he added .

negotiations over the fate of enron , the us energy trading group , had been described as having "" a lot of moving parts "" . yesterday , those parts finally broke loose as the credit rating agencies ' patience ended with a downgrade of the energy trader ' s debt to junk status , and dynegy , its erstwhile saviour , withdrew .
immediate concern centred on the possibility of a systemic risk to the energy markets . "" it ' s over , isn ' t it ? "" said gerald keenan , a partner at pwc . "" what it is going to engender is a daisy chain of defaults . ""
enrononline , the group ' s much - vaunted web - based commodities trading system , shut down , according to traders . counterparties in the energy market stopped trading with enron altogether . the shares , which at their peak last year traded at $ 90 , fell by nearly three - quarters to just over $ 1 . the bonds , which have been trading at levels consistent with imminent bankruptcy for two weeks , fell further .
enron ' s survival since its much smaller rival , dynegy , launched a rescue bid on november 9 , has depended on a fragile pact between dynegy , chevrontexaco ( which owns 26 per cent of dynegy and backed the bid ) , enron ' s lenders , its trading counterparties and the rating agencies . the logic of this pact was essentially circular .
when dynegy stepped in three weeks ago enron was in the early stages of its crisis of confidence . shareholders had been shocked by enron ' s admission that it would have to shrink shareholders ' funds by $ 1 . 2 bn to end a transaction with an off - balance - sheet vehicle established by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . suddenly , the lack of transparency they had been prepared to forgive while the shares rose was a liability .
searching for a way to arrest the downward spiral , ken lay , enron ' s chief executive , linked up with chuck watson , his counterpart at dynegy . dynegy ' s all - stock bid - valuing enron , on tuesday ' s closing prices , at $ 9 . 4 bn - was dependent , however , on the rating agencies not downgrading the energy ' s group ' s substantial debts to junk status .
such a downgrade , as enron explained in a regulatory filing last week , would require the group to repay , refinance or provide extra cash as collateral for some $ 3 . 9 bn of debts owed by off - balance - sheet trusts .
under pressure from enron and dynegy ' s bankers , the agencies refrained from downgrading the debt , and dynegy went ahead with its bid . the agencies justified their position by citing the pending bid .
it was an uncomfortable position for the agencies , however , and their resolve began to crumble last week as dynegy and enron talked about renegotiating the deal .
in a tersely worded note issued last wednesday , fitch , another rating agency , pointed out that if dynegy "" steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems highly untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible "" .
yesterday , s & p , then moody ' s and fitch , finally broke the fragile ring of confidence that was holding lenders , bidders and enron itself together . in its note , s & p explained in stark terms how the virtuous circle of confidence might now become a vicious downward spiral .
the collapse of enron securities in capital markets made dynegy less likely to complete its takeover , s & p wrote . at the same time , enron ' s franchise in the energy markets had "" sustained significant damage "" , making it a less attractive target .
if enron does now disintegrate , the question is whether the chain reaction will extend beyond the houston company and drag in other energy traders , or even the banks that finance them . analysts had already begun to liken its situation to that of long - term capital management , whose demise in 1998 prompted the federal reserve to co - ordinate a rescue by wall street banks to avoid a financial crisis .
however , the head of one large commodities trader said the biggest market participants had had long enough to protect themselves from the collapse of enron .
but smaller groups could be affected and the fear is that the complexities of its balance sheet may still contain the seeds of a wider crisis . additional reporting by sheila mcnulty in houston .

new york - - enron corp . ' s lifeline merger deal collapsed wednesday , and the once - mighty energy trader slid toward all - but - certain bankruptcy .
its houston rival and neighbor dynegy inc . called off its planned takeover after wall street ' s major credit - rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to "" junk "" status wednesday morning .
investors and enron ' s trading partners had lost confidence well before the rating agencies did . in fact , it was the recent erosion of enron ' s trading business and the harrowing slide in its stock and bond prices that forced the ratings cut and triggered dynegy ' s decision to back out of the deal .
informed sources said dynegy ultimately balked after coming across much more debt than it expected in evaluating enron ' s finances and watching helplessly as the value of its would - be acquisition shrank dramatically when energy customers fled the firm .
with the merger called off , enron was "" exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" kenneth l . lay , the company ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a brief statement that skirted the topic of bankruptcy .
the lack of a decent credit rating cripples enron ' s ability to run its trading business , the franchise that made it one of america ' s most admired companies but also gave it a reputation for arrogance and greed , particularly for its role in california ' s energy crisis .
computer screens went dark nationwide wednesday as the widely used enrononline internet - based trading system shut down .
enron ' s stock , already down 95 % for the year , tumbled $ 3 . 50 to close at 61 cents on wednesday in a trading stampede on the new york stock exchange . a one - day record of 339 million shares changed hands .
the whole company , once worth $ 63 billion , now is valued at less than $ 500 million , or about twice the cost of enron ' s new headquarters under construction in downtown houston .
dynegy shares , meanwhile , sank $ 4 . 92 to $ 35 . 97 , just below where they stood when dynegy agreed to acquire enron on nov . 9 .
dynegy exited the deal because it was "" unwilling to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" president stephen bergstrom said in a news conference wednesday .
"" we know when to say no , and this morning we said no , "" he said .
wall street had been saying no for days , hammering enron ' s stock to less than half the $ 10 . 41 a share that dynegy originally agreed to pay . dynegy was in the process of renegotiating its price downward when it finally threw in the towel .
the deal ' s lack of credibility with stock and bond investors prompted the top two rating agencies - - standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service - - to cut their ratings on enron , knowing that they probably were pronouncing a death sentence .
the ratings downgrade triggered clauses in enron loan agreements that require the company to immediately pay its creditors some $ 3 . 9 billion - - money that it doesn ' t have , analysts said .
the ripples from enron ' s collapse spread far and wide , even to the u . s . treasury market , where some investors fled for safety as enron ' s bonds plunged in value .
enron led a trend in energy trading , creating an internet - based network that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity , natural gas , oil and coal to do business with one another . the trades of contracts , often spanning many years at a fixed price range , are intended to protect major users and suppliers of energy from fluctuations in fuel prices .
energy market experts are split on the long - term effects of enron ' s collapse . some say the fallout will be slight , noting that rivals already have stepped in to take over business with trading partners who were too nervous to continue dealing with enron .
"" the whole industry should thank dynegy for basically buying them two or three weeks ' time to unwind their deals with enron , "" said analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york .
but enron was noted for the complexity of its long - term deals , and the effects of its withdrawal as a key player could be far - reaching and unexpected , other analysts said .
banking companies , dozens of which lent money to enron , saw their shares dip on worries about whether those loans will be repaid . shares of rival energy companies , too , lost value .
enron ' s chief lenders - - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - - each have about $ 800 million in loans that may be at risk in a bankruptcy , said richard strauss , a bank analyst with goldman , sachs ; photo : ( no caption ) ;

houston - - the likely bankruptcy of enron corp . could lead to a host of troubling consequences , including higher wholesale prices for electricity and natural gas and financial distress for banks and other firms as well as major bondholders and other investors , analysts said wednesday .
however , energy trading markets were calm as enron competitors picked up the slack while looking for opportunities to build or expand their own trading operations and acquire enron assets .
the concerns and maneuvering came as dynegy inc . on wednesday canceled its proposed acquisition of enron , once the world ' s largest energy trading company , after enron ' s debts were downgraded to non - investment "" junk "" status , making a bankruptcy filing highly likely .
"" banks are starting to worry about a financial meltdown from an enron collapse , "" said peter fusaro , president of global change , a risk management consultancy in new york .
enron ' s debts , which had been partly hidden in off - balance - sheet partnerships , could total $ 5 billion more than the company ' s assets , experts in new york and houston estimated .
citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , major commercial bankers to enron , will face losses if enron files for bankruptcy , analysts said . shares of citigroup and morgan declined more than 5 % on wednesday . other experts warned that investment banking firms such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley that had been part of enron ' s sophisticated trading network also could run into problems .
as enron , which rose rapidly in recent years to almost $ 200 billion in annual revenue , neared bankruptcy , shareholders faced being wiped out and investors in about $ 9 billion in enron bonds may get only cents on the dollar , analysts said .
enron ' s employees , 15 , 000 of whom hold enron stock in their 401 ( k ) retirement plans , stood to be among the biggest losers in the company ' s collapse . many probably also will lose their jobs .
major lawsuits against enron claiming lack of loyalty and prudence in dealing with its employees are among scores of lawsuits now confronting the company and arthur andersen , the accounting firm that approved enron ' s financial statements . enron is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for its handling of disclosure of the partnerships and subsidiaries .
and yet as enron ' s crisis approached a possible bankruptcy filing , a brisk optimism prevailed among energy traders . enron competitors were as enthusiastic about opportunities to buy parts of enron as they were fearful of the consequences of the big trader ' s collapse .
stephen baum , chief executive of sempra energy , the san diego - based utility holding company , said enrononline , the houston company ' s highly successful internet - based trading operation , would be acquired by other companies and carry on energy trading in the future .
sempra itself would be interested in discussing formation of such a new online trading firm , baum said , "" although its name would not be enron online . ""
baum added that sempra could be interested in acquiring several enron assets , in the u . s . and abroad .
energy markets were calm wednesday . kevin fox , manager of commodities and trading for aquila energy , a kansas city , mo . - based energy trader , described markets as "" surprisingly orderly . ""
enron ' s troubles have been building for well over a month , fox explained , and so the halt of enron online came as no surprise . fox saw no difficulty in his firm and other trading companies fulfilling enron ' s contracts should the energy company cease to operate .
still , others saw disrupted markets and price volatility . fears about the aftermath of enron ' s collapse centered on long - term commitments the firm has made in recent years to handle all the energy needs of giant entities such as the university of california system or to supply 10 years of natural gas at a fixed price range to an electricity generating station .
problems could arise because long - term contracts typically become encrusted with related transactions that hedge against price movements over time or the interest cost of financing . such complexity could make it difficult for other firms to pick up enron ' s long - term contracts .
if enron in bankruptcy "" can ' t cover its obligations , maybe other wholesalers can ' t either , "" said gordon allott , vice president at kw international , a trading and risk management firm in san francisco .
"" and then you have customers going out into the spot market , which could drive prices higher . that ' s the big bogey monster out there , "" allott said .
however , any effect on consumers from such disruptions could be slight . gerald keenan , head of the energy practice at , noted that enron ' s collapse would not "" affect the basic supply and demand for electricity and natural gas , "" the true determinant of prices .
one major factor reducing the effect of an enron collapse on markets and energy supplies is the growth in recent years of energy trading into a broad industry , with more than $ 300 billion in annual activity in contracts for electricity and the natural gas and oil fuels that produce it .
the intercontinental exchange , a consortium of six trading firms , handles more energy trades today than did enron .
if sempra and other companies acquire and operate enrononline , the industry will have two major groups to rely on . the need for energy trading has been growing out of deregulation and change in the electric utility industry .
"" trading absorbs risks of fuel - price movements and the like that used to be passed on to retail customers in the form of adjustments to monthly bills , "" fox explained .
the breadth and expertise of this new industry , as well as the months of enron ' s decline that gave competitors and markets time to adjust , could promise a relatively stable aftermath of enron ' s downfall .
however , the post - enron future is likely to see closer regulation of energy contract trading to increase disclosure of terms and risks .
but enron and its top executives , along with the arthur andersen accounting firm , face months and possibly years of lawsuits from shareholders who suffered losses as enron ' s stock lost more than $ 60 billion of market value in a single year .
and lawsuits by enron employees , challenging the firm ' s treatment of 401 ( k ) accounts , will go forward even if enron is in bankruptcy , said attorney lynn sarko of keller rohrback , a seattle law firm that is bringing one of the suits on behalf of employees .
"" there is still liability faced by fiduciaries , officials who were administrators of the savings plan and by the companies that insured it , "" sarko said .

stocks tumbled wednesday amid investors ' nagging uncertainty about the economy and as energy giant enron headed toward financial collapse . meanwhile , treasury bond yields were little changed . after sliding early in the session , they rebounded after the government got a tepid reception for a record sale of two - year notes .
on wall street , the dow industrials slid 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 6 % , to 9 , 711 . 86 . the market was in a steady decline most of the session .
the tech - dominated nasdaq composite suffered a 2 . 5 % decline , off 48 points to 1 , 887 . 97 .
losers topped winners by about 2 to 1 on the new york stock exchange and on nasdaq .
early in the week the market seemed poised to retake the 10 , 000 level on the dow and the 2 , 000 level on the nasdaq index . instead , sellers have gained the upper hand .
analysts noted that many investors aren ' t convinced the economy will improve in the first half of 2002 . for weeks , hopes that business will improve early next year have been boosting the market .
"" we ' re not out of the woods yet "" with the economy , said richard jandrainof banc one investment advisors corp .
the federal reserve ' s latest report on conditions by region , released wednesday , painted a generally somber picture of the economy .
still , many analysts said stocks ' sell - off this week doesn ' t appear to be anything special .
"" the reality is , we were due for some pullback , "" said barry hyman , chief investment strategist at ehrenkrantz king nussbaum .
hyman and other analysts were actually pleased to see investors take a cautious step back after fearing that the market was rising too much and too quickly .
the market ' s softness was spread across most sectors , but one of the weakest spots was utilities , which dropped after dynegy backed out of its planned merger with enron .
nyse - listed enron broke the record for heaviest trading in a single day with more than 339 million shares changing hands , as it fell $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents . the previous volume record was the 304 million shares of intel traded on nasdaq on sept . 22 , 2000 .
investors were selling most utility stocks wednesday . the dow utilities average fell 2 . 9 % to a 52 - week low of 279 . 95 .
financial stocks were slammed on worries about spillover from an enron collapse . j . p . morgan chase sank $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , and citigroup dropped $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 . both are in the dow .
retailing issues remained vulnerable to concerns that this holiday shopping season will be the worst in a decade . gap stumbled 79 cents to $ 13 . 61 after prudential securities reduced its rating on the clothier to "" sell "" from "" hold "" and called its holiday merchandise poor . electronics retailer best buy fell $ 1 . 18 to $ 69 . 90 , and bed , bath & beyond declined 74 cents to $ 32 . 34 .
technology also was weaker as investors fear there is still too much inventory and not enough demand . chip equipment maker altera fell $ 1 . 83 to $ 21 . 83 ahead of its update on business in the fourth quarter . after the market closed , altera reaffirmed its revenue projections for the year ' s final three months .
ibm , another dow stock , dropped $ 2 . 05 to $ 112 . 15 after announcing it will cut 1 , 000 jobs from its seven u . s . chip plants because of a slowdown in the microprocessor industry .
what was bad for stocks normally would be good for bonds , but that wasn ' t the case by the close of trading wednesday .
yields fell early in the day , then reversed after the government ' s biggest sale ever of two - year notes flooded the market with debt .
the treasury sold $ 21 billion of the two - year notes at a yield of 3 % , up from $ 19 billion sold in october , part of an effort by the government to finance a spending increase using short - dated debt .
the five - year t - note yield ended unchanged at 4 . 29 % . the 10 - year t - note ended at 4 . 93 % , up from 4 . 92 % .

after dynegy pulled out of its deal to buy enron corp . wednesday morning , it appeared the most likely option for enron was bankruptcy protection .
from wall street to houston , it was widely expected enron would file for bankruptcy , perhaps as soon as today .
"" it ' s probably imminent , "" said andre meade , a stock analyst with commerzbank securities in new york .
jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said wednesday night that enron was evaluating all its options for restructuring its balance sheet and debt , and ways to return its business to health .
mcmahon said enron wasn ' t considering a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing , which would involve a liquidation or selling of all assets .
he didn ' t rule out a chapter 11 filing , which lets a company protect assets while it works out a reorganization plan , but he stressed that enron was also reviewing other options .
he declined to describe what the options are , but said he prefers to fix enron without a bankruptcy .
earlier wednesday , enron said it had suspended making payments other than those needed to maintain core business operations and it was working to retain employees needed for its trading and other core energy businesses . no layoffs were announced .
wall street doesn ' t believe enron has real choices other than bankruptcy . shares in enron lost much of their value wednesday , closing at 61 cents . the company , which was dropped from the standard & poor ' s 500 index , also broke the record for most shares traded in a day .
before oct . 16 , a buyout by dynegy , let alone a bankruptcy , were unthinkable for houston ' s largest company and the world ' s largest energy trader . but that day , enron disclosed millions in financial losses related to investment partnerships it did business with and were run by enron ' s since - ousted chief financial officer .
in the days and weeks that followed , the securities and exchange commission started investigating enron , a stack of shareholder and employee lawsuits were filed , enron restated earnings and made disclosures about its balance sheet that wall street found troubling .
dynegy swooped in to rescue enron when the two companies agreed to a merger deal nov . 9 . but continuing bad news surrounding enron put pressure on that deal .
until wednesday morning , it appeared enron and dynegy would find a way to rescue the merger by revamping its terms .
after several days of talks among the companies , bankers and others , chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in an interview he concluded a solution wasn ' t reachable .
the final confirmation for watson was when standard & poor ' s wednesday morning cut enron ' s credit rating to so - called junk status , effectively halting enron ' s ability to run its core business of energy trading and marketing , which is dependent on access to cash and credit . that trading franchise was a key reason for dynegy ' s interest in enron .
s & p said in its rating report that it cut enron ' s credit rating because it didn ' t believe the merger , which wasn ' t expected to close for six to nine months , would go through .
when the companies inked the deal on nov . 9 , watson said he expected no more surprises about enron ' s financial state . but the deal included escape clauses just in case .
among reasons dynegy cited for ending the merger were "" breaches of representations "" by enron . it also invoked an escape provision that let dynegy to walk away if enron had a "" material adverse change "" in its business .
"" we have never been willing to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" watson said . "" we knew when to say no and this morning we said no . ""
since nov . 9 , enron made new financial disclosures and saw significant drops in its stock price and trading business . all of that caused dynegy to seek new terms for the merger agreement , including a lower price , cash infusions to stabilize enron and a restructuring of enron ' s debt repayment schedule .
watson traced the beginning of the end to nov . 19 , the day enron filed its 10 q with securities regulators . companies must file their 10 q every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet with the sec .
dynegy was hit by surprise when enron disclosed it would have to pay off a specific debt obligation worth $ 690 million almost immediately and when it saw that enron ' s cash situation wasn ' t what it expected , watson said .
those disclosures , he said , caused enron ' s trading business , which had somewhat of an uptick after the merger announcement , to go "" down again and down again . ""
"" that was sort of a blow that we never really recovered from , "" watson said .
watson said he worked hard to rescue the deal , but would only go for a "" global solution "" that would take care of all the problems . for one , he said , enron needed another $ 1 billion - $ 3 billion infusion to keep going .

another jolt

shortly after enron corp . ' s bond ratings were cut to junk status wednesday , energy trader charlie sanchez watched the company ' s trading business simply vanish from his computer screen .
"" i watched their different markets just peel off my screen , one by one , "" said sanchez , energy markets manager at gelber & associates in houston .
although enron ' s troubles were well - known , the collapse of enron ' s trading business wednesday still jolted traders . sanchez just said , "" i ' m in shock . ""
the downgrade of enron ' s debt was the first domino to fall wednesday , followed by the shutdown of enron ' s online trading business and then the announcement that dynegy had called off its deal to buy enron .
enrononline , the company ' s internet commodity trading platform , went down early wednesday , signaling that the company had temporarily halted trading altogether . enrononline handles about 60 percent of the company ' s trading business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in deals .
enron ' s chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said he didn ' t know when enrononline would be up for trading again . however , the company continues to do telephone transactions , he said .
the commodities markets appeared to weather the event . but the shutdown of the company that was by far the biggest player in the market led other companies that regularly dealt with enron to hastily issue statements assuring investors they were not going to be dragged down as well .
with enrononline down , many traders had to revert to calling around to numerous sources to find out what the market was doing rather than simply logging onto enrononline and clicking on a single tab to size up the market where they wanted to trade .
but as far as the overall impact on commodities markets and the new york mercantile exchange , the loss of enron ' s trading business for whatever period likely will not be that big , said kyle cooper , oil analyst with salomon smith barney in houston .
"" it could widen the bid - ask spreads in a few places , but in terms of liquidity on the nymex , you ' re talking about a few thousand contracts out of 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 contracts in all , "" cooper said .
one trader described enron as "" a needle in a haystack in terms of the total long - term capital markets . ""
nonetheless , the shutdown prompted a call for closer monitoring during a briefing at the white house .
u . s . treasury department officials kept a close eye on the credit and energy markets wednesday but discerned no upheavals from the troubles at enron .
"" we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day "" treasury spokeswoman michele davis said . "" we haven ' t seen anything extraordinary . ""
the exit of enron will lead to a change in the balance of power in the trading business . traders said companies that likely will benefit from the loss of enron ' s trading activities include el paso corp . , mirant corp . , reliant energy and duke energy .
the market appeared more worried about possible losses connected with enron .
el paso corp . ' s stock took a beating wednesday - - down $ 3 . 59 to close at $ 44 . 91 - - over concerns that it had too much exposure to enron through its trading business . the company issued a statement saying it had "" systematically reduced its trading with enron "" over the past few weeks .
"" due to enron ' s loss of investment grade status , any new business will have to be supported by cash collateral . el paso foresees no material disruptions in the energy trading markets resulting from today ' s downgrades or the potential of an enron bankruptcy filing , "" according to the company ' s statement .
el paso ' s natural gas and power trading exposure to enron is about $ 50 million , the company said , adding that it does not expect any adverse earnings impact from enron ' s difficulties .
atlanta - based mirant said its exposure to enron is $ 50 million to $ 60 million , noting that it too had begun limiting its exposure risk early in what it described as "" the enron crisis . ""
calpine corp . said it had no "" net exposure "" to enron , which means that what enron owes calpine for gas and electric trading is offset by calpine ' s liabilities to enron .
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . as a result , they were either demanding more collateral to ensure it delivered on trades or restricting dealings with the houston - based company .
"" each company is going to have to evaluate what their situation is from producers to utilities , it ' s going to be a case - by - case situation . it ' s going to take a long time to figure it all out , "" said one trader who asked not to be quoted by name .
shortly after the news of the company ' s latest problems broke , a flood of huge trading orders came out of enron , leading traders to speculate that the company was scrambling to clear its accounts before filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
a typical order from the company would be for 100 contracts in a single lot to buy or sell commodities such as natural gas . after the debt downgrade was announced , single orders for 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 contracts began coming from the company .
the flood of large orders out of enron caused the near - month futures contract on the new york mercantile exchange to spike up and then fall off just as quickly in late morning trading .
"" they could not leave this exposure to the whims of the market , "" one trader said . "" they needed to get out . ""
enron reportedly has been working over the past few weeks to line up alternate parties to hand off their thousands of contracts the company handles daily , many of which are for long term periods such as 10 to 15 years .
but some of the more obscure contracts on items such as emissions credits and weather derivatives may be more difficult to unload . in addition to natural gas , power and oil , enron trades such items as broadband , paper , metals and water .
"" i really think that a lot of the kinds of stuff that is foreign and esoteric that enron has been making a market in will take a while for others to pick up , "" sanchez said .

bankruptcy filing by enron could be largest ever
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
if enron files for chapter 11 bankruptcy this week , as many observers expect it will , it may be the largest such event to date .
with $ 61 . 7 billion in assets on its books as of sept . 30 , the deal would top texaco ' s 1987 bankruptcy , which sought protection for a company with $ 35 . 9 billion in assets . it would also beat the 1988 bankruptcy of financial corporation of america , which had $ 33 . 9 billion in assets .
the value of the assets and liabilities on enron ' s books continues to be a moving target , however . while enron ' s unaudited quarterly financial report indicates $ 61 . 7 billion in assets , $ 27 billion in liabilities , $ 6 . 5 billion in long - term debt and $ 15 . 3 billion in deferred credits , the turmoil of the past month has changed much of that .
on the asset side , for example , the company says properties like its natural gas transmission lines , fiber optic network and electric generation facilities are worth close to $ 14 . 6 billion . much of the gas pipeline properties have been encumbered in recent weeks , however , by the company ' s efforts to raise additional cash and credit from banks .
and the likelihood the company could find buyers to pay its asking price for assets like the fiber optic network or overseas power plants is highly unlikely , said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst with rating agency fitch .
"" it ' s really a buyer ' s market , not a seller ' s market , "" pellechia said . "" it ' s anticipated a lot of their assets , particularly their international assets , would go for a lot less than the initial investment in them . ""
the company also counts $ 7 . 1 billion in investments and advances to "" unconsolidated affiliates "" as assets , which could include enron equity that was used to back some of the complicated off - balance - sheet financing partnerships that led to the company ' s current woes . given the constant surprises surrounding those partnerships and the company ' s steeply dropping stock price - - now worth less than a cup of coffee - - that $ 7 . 1 billion figure is also suspect .
several unexpected debt obligations related to the partnerships enron operated have also changed the tally since sept . 30 . analysts say debts for the company range between $ 13 billion and $ 17 billion , including another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments related to two special partnerships , osprey trust and marlin water trust , that will come due more quickly than expected following the credit rating agency downgrades on wednesday .
"" all these changes are making the situation like sand falling between their fingers , "" said bill porter , chairman of houston law firm porter & hedges . "" the only alternative left to them to stabilize their situation is bankruptcy protection . ""
company officials say they ' re still reviewing options , but on wednesday said they are temporarily suspending all payments to creditors other than those needed to maintain core energy trading operations .
"" with dynegy ' s termination of the merger and the ratings agency downgrades , we are evaluating and exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement .
sources familiar with the broken enron - dynegy deal said the paperwork for a bankruptcy filing has been in the works for weeks , and even preceded the nov . 9 merger announcement . they say if the preliminary deal had not been secured that day , enron would have had to file for bankruptcy the following monday .
recent efforts by enron ' s bankers , including j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , to get creditors to hold off on demanding payments may mean the pending bankruptcy filing will be what is known as a prepackaged deal .
in a prepackaged bankruptcy , creditors agree beforehand how the sale of the company ' s assets would be divided among them . it would save all parties untold millions in legal fees that would be spent fighting over the company while assuring at least some recovery of their investments .
prepackaged bankruptcies are common , said jay westbrook , a professor at the university of texas school of law , because they allow companies to buy parts of the faltering business they want without the hassles of long , drawn - out legal battles .
"" the purchasers will essentially just pay their money and walk away , with the proceeds getting divided up among those holding claims , "" westbrook said .
chapter 11 bankruptcy has the added benefit of freezing the many lawsuits that have been filed by angry shareholders . those lawsuits would eventually be handled by the bankruptcy court , including determination of the validity of the claims in the suits .
if enron ' s bankruptcy is not prepackaged , it ' s almost assured that the value of enron ' s remaining businesses , such as its energy trading , will disappear , said bob chapman , a principle with houston management consulting firm king , chapman & broussard .
"" the only guys that do well in bankruptcies are the lawyers , "" chapman said . "" what you usually see is a long period of people trying to carve up the beast where what remains of the business will continue to atrophy . ""
because the company will most likely look to simply liquidate its assets , what would at first be a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing could later be converted to a chapter 7 filing , where a court - appointed trustee overseas liquidation of the remaining assets .
"" from our perspective , a lot of the future rests in the hands of the banks , "" said fitch analyst glen grabelsky . "" what their intentions are in granting forbearance , what kind of liquidity they ' re willing to extend to enron , only they can answer . ""

ballpark place project stopped dead in tracks
by ralph bivins
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
construction of the ballpark place tower has been postponed , partly because of the uncertainty surrounding enron corp . , the project ' s developer announced wednesday .
trammell crow co . had anticipated breaking ground this week on the 34 - story tower across from enron field , said matt khourie , who heads trammell crow operations in houston .
ballpark place was planned for a parcel of land owned by the developer , bounded by preston , prairie , crawford and la branch streets .
the $ 108 million ballpark place was expected to be a dominant skyline feature , rising over left field at enron ' s namesake stadium .
ballpark place would have included 253 , 000 square feet of office space , 216 apartment units , ground - level retail space and several levels of covered parking .
questions surrounding the future of enron corp . , a major employer in downtown , was key in encouraging trammell crow to shelve its plans , khourie said .
enron has about 3 million square feet of downtown office space , including a 40 - story building under construction . as enron ' s need for space decreases , the downtown office market is sure to feel the aftershocks .
"" given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the future availability of class - a space springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to delay our construction start until the future visibility improves , "" khourie said in a written statement .
it has been widely speculated that dynegy , another houston energy firm , would move into the new enron building .
but dynegy ' s plans to buy enron fell apart wednesday , leaving questions about the the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot tower .
trammell crow has not abandoned its plans for ballpark place .
khourie said the company intends to start construction , perhaps next year , after the economy improves .
"" we are still very bullish on the project ' s residential / office mixed - use concept for our unique location and also are optimistic on the mid - and long - term prospects for houston ' s central business district , "" khourie said .
"" the decision to delay relates directly to the short - term environment that we are currently facing . """,-1
14138,"entergy joins setrans ( southern , etal ) rto","entergy has joined the se trans rto ( southern , etal ) . i will review the ferc filing ; however , an entergy rep called me today to ask for enron ' s support stating that the new rto proposal includes :
- - independent market operator ( he said such as pjm )
- - no day ahead balanced schedules
- - lmp
- - one oasis and one tariff ( no separate tariff for entergy ' s itc )
- - one security coordinator
- - initial license plate rate within entergy area
- - local planning in entergy footprint
he also said that they are trying to have the gridsouth group agree to use the same independent market operator so there would be one market structure for the southeast .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

here is what i came up with on the ivanhoe station .
>",-1
6593,sas,"to the group :
if you wish to use sas , there are a few simple things you need to do :
1 ) you need to get a unix password if you don ' t already have one ( your user
id will be the same as on the nt network , but a different password is issued )
2 ) you need a program called "" exceed "" on your pc . request it from it ( you
already have this if you are already a user of lim on the unix platform )
3 ) you need an "" ftp "" program on your pc . you can go to www . download . com and
download one ( i like wsftp )
4 ) exceed is funny in the way it runs . when you invoke exceed ( or lim
advanced user ( under infobases ) if you already have this ) it will install
itself the first time , and will then "" disappear "" to the taskbar . you need to
* right * click on the taskbar on exceed , and then choose "" tools "" and "" client
startup "" and then "" new . ""
you will enter a box which should already be set for rexec and an xwindow
emulation . you need to specify the host type as sun , enter your user name and
password , set the host name to :
capers . ect . enron . com
and then , on the command line , type the following ( carefully ) :
/ usr / openwin / bin / xterm - display @ d
then , use the file menu to save this as capers . xs and then click on the run !
menu . within a second or two , a window will open up with you logged into the
serve capers . you are now on a unix server , and the directory is your home
directory . from here , if you simply type "" sas "" the 3 windows for an
interactive session with sas should open on your desktop . you are in business .
5 ) you also need to install your ftp . follow the procedures with the
software , and then create a new session called "" enron "" where you choose as
the server simply "" earth "" ( do not add any further descriptors such as
. enron . com ) . supply your user name and * unix * password , check the "" remember
password "" box , and the default communication setups should be correct ( eg ,
host type as "" automatic detect "" ) .
when you invoke ftp and connect to enron , it will put you in your home
directory on the unix system , the same directory your xwindow comes up in
under exceed .
if you have any problems , i ' ll be happy to help
clayton
ps i have a complete set of new sas manuals i am happy to loan out if you ' ll
just write your name down when you take them .",-1

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

23228,merchant asset group,"sally ,
this morning i spent some time with david maxwell of the merchant asset
group . i am very intrigued by the work the group does . knowing that todd
hall has moved on to egm and that the merchant asset group is in transition
to report to shona wilson , i have a recommendation . i would like for the
merchant asset group to report to me . although i do not know all the
methodologies used by the group , i am familiar with the valuation of assets
and understand the underlying principals for most methods . at fleming i was
involved , at a much smaller scale , in the reporting of similar portfolios and
believe that i can be of assistance to the group in moving away from their
current spread sheet environment . also , i enjoyed talking with david maxwell
and understand what he is up against . i believe he and i would work really
well together .
let me know what you think .
thanks .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

22977,ena sap project,"as you know , we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this
project . today , we are making what i hope are final changes to the maps and
deliverables , with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete
binders by wednesday .
one issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment
processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the
automated unify / sap environment . this issue was raised by melissa during our
discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability
of sap to auto - match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the
money has moved or been received , but the corresponding je has not been made
in sap . both melissa and cindy morrow have been involved in subsequent
discussions related to the below - mentioned risks .
1 . risk of je and payment duplication :
payments taken directly to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in
unify :
in the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is
entered initially into unify ( which would be the case for all normal
commodity payments , excluding broker fee and broker margin payment
transactions ) , a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid
twice ( once by either a / p or treasury when the manual payment is wired and
subsequently recorded , and once during the normal unify to sap interface ) .
process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk ; however , all
controls will be people - based , not system - based . it is too late to rebuild
the unify to sap interface to better address the use of manual payments . one
additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of
manual payments except under well - defined , important circumstances .
payments taken to treasury , and underlying transaction is recorded directly
to sap ( does not go through unify ) :
if the payment is not entered into sap with payment method "" j "" , a / p will not
realize that the payment has already been made and will process the
disbursement a second time .
2 . risk of understated expense :
payments taken to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in unify :
for manual payments that are not finalized in unify ( a process performed in
the system to mark an invoice as final ) by month - end ( but the disbursement
has already happened ) , expense will be understated .
payments taken to treasury , and underlying transaction is recorded directly
to sap ( does not go through unify ) :
if payment is not input into sap by month - end but cash has moved , expense
will be understated . ( cash outflow account will show a credit balance which
will be flipped to a / p , but no income statement entry will be made at that
time . )
3 . risk of cash misappropriation :
in addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments , we also
believe that a risk exists related to the use of excel - generated counterparty
invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for
preparing these invoices and also for handling / having access to the related
accounting records . we believe that it may be possible for a settlements
coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on
the excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the
accounting records during the cash application process to either write off
the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while
constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another
( so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range ) . we have been
unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk .
4 . revision to counterparty banking details :
we are currently investigating the procedure performed by treasury when
problems with bank account details cause payments to kick - out of treasury
workstation . if the risk of misappropriation exists related to this
procedure , we will separately communicate .
the above may be unclear . if so , we would be glad to sit down with you for
15 minutes or so and clarify . please let me know if you have any questions .
thank you for the opportunity to work on this project .",-1

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

11112,california update 3 / 06 / 01,"executive summary
? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .
? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :
puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value
? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing utility .
? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some details :
of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this summer
some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months
none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot market
? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly announce a 10 % rate hike .
? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .
pg & e
transmissions deal
one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now .
pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings . but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then pg & e will be left holding the bag .
thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .
the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative . remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution .
on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives
the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads .
? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 % above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .
? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .
? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving .
thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they come up with something even more outrageous . ""
pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .
davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year
while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires . that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .
ferc
the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .
one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them "" could easily become chairman .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .

on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and

do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to
you ) .
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need ,

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

shukaly resigned and left .
but i assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that whoever they want can attend .
i would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the groups on friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an offsite together . how about circulating the presentation and then letting them refer all questions to rahil - see how much interest you get . one on ones are much better and i think this is how rahil should proceed . we need to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks .
let ' s aim to get a least three customers this quarter .

i add the total p / l due to contract rollover . when the number of trades is

and the spread is not too small , the model prints a lot of money , dominated by
those trade earning the half of bo spread .
i also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page . i think we

ready to deliever the model v . 1 .
the next step is to incorporate the intra - day market movement by using high

dynegy vs . enron :
a "" tale of two companies ""
by will mcnamara
director , electric industry analysis
facts : dynegy inc . ( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry .
let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues .
as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector .
dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , "" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . "" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business .
the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities .
on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio .
consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "" great debate "" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . "" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , "" lay said . "" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . ""
moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company "" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital "" and that enron "" spent too much too soon "" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter .
dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business .
it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions .
at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous .
in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies .

thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .

2743,"re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225","in response to cheryl ' s note , in looking at a copy of a confirmation letter
confirming the proposed agreement reached on march 1 , 2000 to be effective
april 1 , 2000 through march 31 , 2001 , there is evergreen language .
a termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to exxon with an original
to follow for their records .
cheryl , this gtc is different from the ones we usually see in that hpl
required signatures from both parties executed by exxon on 3 / 30 / 00 and hpl on

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

11104,merchant asset reclass in dpr,"we have been asked to reclassify the merchant assets on the dpr . currently , these assets are shown below the total trading line of the dpr , because , as per the risk policy , they should not be considered when assessing trading activities against the trading limits .
by the end of this week , we plan to show the merchant assets p & l for each group separately under the appropriate business , and then reverse the p & l at the bottom of the dpr to arrive at total trading p & l . currently , there are no plans to allocate merchant asset var or positions separate business units . in order to show total merchant asset p & l , positions and var the merchant asset summary currently at the bottom of the dpr will be retained .
i am attaching a sample version of the changes discussed above . please call me at x 39123 if you have any questions or concerns about these changes .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .

included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

dorothy -
please advise lisa that our expectation is that each business unit will
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their
workforce ( as is the case today ) .
corporate may intercede only to the point that a business unit fails to
design to a sufficient density ( average sq . ft . per workplace ) and does not
meet minimum . hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus
from enron ' s executive committee before detailed space planning begins .

7942,wharton collaborative research,"here is a short note on potential research with wharton . please review and
edit and then we can send some indication to the wharton guys . - - - - - - - - - -
the objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take ,
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure . in
particular , one can view enron as a hierarchy of companies , and assuming we
can separately quantify the risks of each unit , what framework would one use
to analyze risk at enron ?
a related question is how one should represent risks in the different
units ? risks may be of different types - - - short - term volatility risk ,
catastrophic risk , liquidity risk , etc - - - what should one focus on for a
first cut ?
another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance
both at the unit level and the enterprise level , and relate the decision to
get insurance to the cost / benefit of insurance .",-1

let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,

jay ,
if a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal ; therefore , we request the deals be zeroed out . call me if this is a problem . also , we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed .
in addition , i have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

included . . .
two new reporting enhancements .

12745,e nymex : market forces - enymex still on launchpad .,"market forces - enymex still on launchpad .
09 / 07 / 2001
energy compass
( c ) 2001 energy intelligence group . all rights reserved
the new york mercantile exchange has been thinking about shifting some of its
business online since early last year - - and possibly before that - when it
was invited to join the electronic ( ice ) . it rejected
the offer - which rival international petroleum exchange has since gladly
accepted - instead unveiling plans last may to build its own electronic
trading platform for over - the - counter and smaller futures contracts . but its
cyberspace initiative is still on the launchpad .
called enymex , the online system was supposed to launch in october 2000 , at
the same time as the big oil - backed ice . but october came and went , and while
ice appeared , enymex failed to show . its start date was pushed back to late
2000 - and then to the first quarter of 2001 , and then to the second quarter
of this year . nymex held to that second - quarter target for months , before
again failing to deliver . it ' s now given up on the third quarter as well , and
exchange executives have stopped trying to predict when the electronic trading
platform will be ready to go .
that ' s not the only blow to nymex ' s e - trade strategy . delays are also plaguing
an internet version of its existing access after - hours electronic trading
system , although it remains available as a proprietary , dial - up system to
existing customers .
late last month , nymex announced plans to make access available over the
internet - at www . nymexaccess . com - in a move designed to widen its customer
base . but just a few days before the planned sep . 3 start date , the exchange
pulled back ( ec aug . 31 , p 3 ) . as with enymex , a new date has yet to be
scheduled . launched in 1993 , the dial - up version of access handled 2 . 1 million
contracts last year , equal to 2 % of nymex ' s total trading volume . nymex
executives say that putting access on the web could triple the volume of
business completed on the platform . the exchange ' s new brent crude oil futures
contract and other existing pit - traded contracts are available on access .
compared with ice - which is steadily unveiling new services and products on
its e - trade system - the new york exchange ' s path to building an electronic
platform has been bumpy . earlier this year , nymex ended its relationship with
accenture ( formerly andersen consulting ) , which had been involved in managing
the exchange ' s transition to an electronic trading platform almost from the
start . some observers characterized the move as a cost - cutting measure ; nymex
says accenture was dismissed because its work was done .
nymex blames many of the delays on globalview software , one of its technology
partners , with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute . in april , nymex
filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a new york court against globalview ,
alleging that the chicago - based software firm had stopped work on enymex , and
seeking unspecified damages . globalview chief executive jon olson admits that
his company did indeed stop work , but says it was because nymex stopped
paying . it is countersuing , seeking around $ 26 million for fees and damages .
nymex president bo collins is also claiming that globalview has gone bankrupt .
but olson says business is good for the 20 - year - old company , which has around
150 clients in the energy industry .
with globalview off the project , nymex has decided it will build the
"" front - end "" piece of enymex - the part that globalview was working on .
when it ' s all complete , nymex will have an e - trade platform for derivatives
and smaller futures contracts , and a separate e - trade service for its
after - hours customers . it will also have its existing pit - traded contracts ,
which it has no intention of ditching .
with so many different pieces , some observers wonder what nymex is up to .
collins , a one - time natural gas trader at us - based el paso , responds that
nymex aims to build an "" electronic cloud "" around its successful pit contracts .
rather than disrupt a successful business , collins says the exchange is
creating new , electronic trading opportunities around its pit - traded products .
"" the reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense
liquidity to the market , "" he says . "" so i have got to figure out a way to marry
the technology to the humanness of the process . ""
for example , nymex ' s henry hub natural gas futures contract is successful , and
several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the henry hub
price . that ' s where enymex will come in , collins says : the e - trade platform
will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of nymex ' s pit
contracts - thus marrying technology and the trading pit .
some observers suggest that the enymex roll - out has taken a back seat to the
exchange ' s newest product , a brent crude oil futures contract challenging the
ipe . the new contract , which started trading on sep . 5 , was joined the
following day by a new brent options contract . on sep . 7 , the new york
exchange started offering a brent - wti spread options contract .
the battle for the hearts and minds of brent traders will rage in the
traditional trading pits of new york and london for another year , at least .
but over the next 12 - 18 months , all of the ipe ' s business will be shifted
online to a futures trading platform being built by ice .
the ipe ' s strategy is clear . by agreeing to be acquired by ice , the london
exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in
cyberspace - not in a trading pit . nymex is betting that its "" electronic
cloud "" strategy - whereby e - trade is married with pit trading - will pay off .
in the end , though , the e - trade versus pit trade battle being waged by the
world ' s two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle
for brent . if nymex can create liquidity in its new brent contract , its bumpy
path toward e - trade may be forgotten .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .

27454,transfers from ees,"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .
once you have signed off on your groupings , rachel massey in corporate planning will be working with each of you to forecast your q 3 and q 4 cost center expense plans .
please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .

16295,re : releases,"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

subject : re : a note being sent out under john sherriff ' s name - your thoughts
on the cover note ?
i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental
operating standards , but i wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough
of a global message ( it is a european note ) and the means of delivery . on
the means of delivery , i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully
understand the intent . is there an article to be included in an enron
publication ( yes ) and in addition a letter to be sent under john ' s name ( if
so , to whom will the letter be sent ) ? or is the letter from john an
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ? ( yes - apologies
if there is confusion )
with regard to a global message , i think that one of the key points around
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in
nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in
trading activities . with these operating standards implemented worldwide , we
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we
will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in
operating standards worldwide . these global standards also should enable
enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined
requirements with regard to trading operations . i am not sure from the
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .
agreed - but the note was targeted at europe - would welcome the opportunity
to work on this with you and shona )
finally , a question regarding timing . the last i knew after you and brent
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this
was being circulated ( shona took this to do after brent ' s return to houston )
for comments to all business controllers . i don ' t believe that we are quite
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have
reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards . and not to
belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real
meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis
against these standards . my commitment to rick causey is that i will have
that global report in production by the end of the year . there is much work
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report . shona
has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this , and i believe that mike has
already been working with james new . so i question whether or not you want
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report
against . would a more appropriate time be after the global operations
controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy - in and
commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful
exception report ? can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to
shona
sorry that this response looks so long . i have been interrupted 20 times
while responding , so i hope that it makes sense . thanks for sharing this
with me . since you asked for input , i hope that you don ' t mind that i gave
you some . - - sally - certainly not - and thanks

6638,re : clayton vernon,"i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is
temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him . according to enron
policy , an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or
better . this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one
organization to the another . this sounds like a "" work ethic "" issue to me and
the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he
is temporarily successful . but if kevin presto knows the situation and he
still wants vernon in the end , i will push for an exception as this satisfies
our obligation to be forthright . please keep me informed of clayton ' s
progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem
employee . thanks .

kevin ,
vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for
transfer will be rejected . anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody .
clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered )
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be
aware of it , because i have
serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

devon has told amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven ' t made a commitment yet . if devon doesn ' t cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point , then we will have to explore other options to get this gas / $ $ $ $ .

all
my preferred approach to dealing with anjam ' s departure is given below .
these recommendations are informed by the fact that i don ' t feel anjam has
much to offer his next employer , except what code and data he can remove from
enron :
hr - type stuff :
1 . get anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible . there is no need for
him to remain on the floor .
2 . determine where anjam is heading . we need to know who is going to know
our positions and curves next .
it - type stuff :
1 . ask him to catalogue the contents of his h : drive , since the rest of the
group will need to support his work in the future . this should take no more
than a day or two .
2 . get it to obtain their backups of anjam ' s h : drive for weekly intervals
over the last two months . this will allow us to determine what he has
deleted .
3 . get it to provide a snapshot of anjam ' s notes folders , and provide records
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months . i ' m worried
about code / data he may have zipped up and mailed out .
4 . ask it to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from
anjam ' s c : drives . there may be useful info here too .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

i must apologize . i have not had time to look over the proposal in any
detail . when i first spoke with your friend , it was apparent that he was
still pre - business plan stage . he has since sent me some ideas and
information . i think the concept has merit , but there are so many political
issues that i am concerned about the ultimate business viability .
give me the weekend to look over the information .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

unfortunately , i have a sick day scheduled ( babies will do this kind of thing
to you ) and will not come into the office .
would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a
few ( possibly ) interested individuals ? this might give us more shceduling
flexibility and would also seem more appropriate , knowing that what i have is
a set of suggestions for development and no earth - shuttering , live product .

yannis ,
shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled . let her know
what audio - visual materials you ' ll need . keep in mind that the research group
is now about 40 people , some of whom will be watching the presentation on
video from portland and from london . the best platform would be to get a
pc - video or pc - screen link - up , so that everyone , including people watching
remotely , can see your computer ' s monitor on a big screen .
the itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11 : 30 and eat lunch and trade
news for the first 30 - 45 minutes , and then at 12 : 00 or 12 : 30 at the latest ,
we have a presentation . we try to wrap up by 1 : 00 , so that what we discussed
yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way .
from my experience , the audio - visual people need at least an hour advance
warning to get the screens linked up . let me know if you need any help in
getting you and jenny the things you need .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

1561,mobil chemical - hpl meter # 1256 - expense transport,"ed - can you help ? i need to know the term of our existing transport expense
deal with reliant entex to serve the referenced customer . we must have an
existing contract that we can look up . our existing deal to sell to mobil
expires october 1 . i am trying to make a two year sales offer beginning
october 1 . if the transport expires before then , then we ' ll need to call
entex about a transport rate . who is the correct dealmaker to call entex on
this matter ? ? i ' d be happy to do it , but i ' d be stepping on somebody else ' s
turf .
if the existing rate is indeed 5 cents plus 2 . 02 % fuel , that seems kind of
high . it ' s a short haul - according to our field folk , we give the gas to
entex at the la porte city gate , and it goes to the mobil plant at pasadena ,
about 10 miles away at the most .
any and all help appreciated .

williams signs $ 10 million weather and climate research alliance with the university of oklahoma
august 27 , 2001 09 : 02 : 00 am et
increased accuracy of weather prediction technology
provides significant economic advantages for energy industry leader
tulsa , okla . , aug . 27 / prnewswire / - - a unit of williams wmb today announced a $ 10 million strategic alliance with the university of oklahoma ( ou ) to enhance weather and climate research , technology development , and undergraduate and graduate meteorology education .
this commercial arrangement , the largest of its kind in the u . s . between a private corporation and a university meteorology program , is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows ou to expand its top - tier meteorology programs while williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools . this will give williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading , while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for williams the nation ' s most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers .
"" this is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit , "" keith e . bailey , williams chairman , president and ceo , said . "" this alliance provides williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to williams ' unique needs . with weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets , we expect to see a significant return on our investment . ""
"" this history making agreement between williams and the university of oklahoma ' s school of meteorology , a national leader in its field , is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sector - university partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth , and the expansion of knowledge , "" said ou president david l . boren . "" i predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together american international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality . we are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the university by williams . ""
highlights of this expansive agreement include :
* unique , advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by
the university of oklahoma ' s weather programs specifically for williams '
weather - sensitive businesses .
* a grant of $ 8 . 1 million over five years to fund research in advanced
weather analysis and prediction at the center for analysis and
prediction of storms ( caps ) . this includes funding for a supercomputer
that will be most powerful among all big - 12 institutions .
* a grant of $ 1 . 6 million over five years to fund regional climate
research at the cooperative institute for mesoscale meteorological
studies . this money will bring to ou the most advanced climate system
model in the world , and will fund research scientists as well as
graduate and undergraduate students .
* gifts to create the williams endowed chair , an advanced student computer
laboratory , funding for three williams fellows in the master of science
in professional meteorology degree in the school of meteorology and a
gift to the oklahoma climatological survey .
"" we believe the outcome of this partnership will yield a world class suite of weather forecast and analysis products suited for use in the energy marketing and trading industry , "" says denise russell , director of market analysis at williams ' energy marketing and trading unit , who , in 1998 began to hire ou meteorology graduates . "" we also will have a valuable pipeline for new technological and human resource capabilities with which to maintain these developments . ""
according to dr . john snow , dean of the ou college of geosciences and director of oklahoma weather center programs , the school of meteorology , has already begun to aggressively recruit some of the nation ' s top graduate students as part of the new partnership , and will expand this effort in the next several months now that the contracts are signed .
"" through this alliance with williams , the university of oklahoma has obtained the resources necessary to continue generating new knowledge , defining the global standard for weather technology and developing outstanding graduates , all while bringing new jobs and opportunities to oklahoma in weather - related fields , "" says snow .
the williams / ou alliance was made possible through technology advances in computing resources and the enactment of oklahoma state questions 680 and 681 , which provide for the establishment of commercial entities that are licensed for the exclusive right to commercialize the technology developed within research and development sections of universities .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

subject : netco
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .
i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis . please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list .
communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are . i am asking david oxley to co - ordinate with all of you on this . i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible .
if you are unavailable this week , please ensure you delegate this work out .
happy new year

enron discusses credit line of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion with banks

enron corp . , scrambling to restore confidence in its finances , is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion , and is likely to close a deal within days , according to officials familiar with the matter .
the new credit line is intended to bolster enron ' s financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence . the new credit would supplement existing lines , which are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about $ 3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock , bond and energy markets .
an enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but said he couldn ' t supply any further details .
houston - based enron is the nation ' s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . once a favorite of wall street , the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that , despite difficulties , its finances remain sound .
confidence in enron ' s financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
last week , enron replaced mr . fastow and said that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions . the company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal .
enron ' s stock price fell again friday . as of 4 p . m . , in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down 95 cents at $ 15 . 40 . enron shares have fallen 50 % in the past two weeks and are down 83 % from a sept . 18 , 2000 , high of $ 89 . 63 .
late last week , enron tapped its existing credit lines , with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $ 2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper , or short - term corporate ious . ron barone of credit - rating agency standard & poor ' s said he believes that enron was "" getting a bit more resistance "" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due . thus , enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding , he said .
the enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $ 1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility .
also last week , credit - rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing enron ' s debt and commercial - paper ratings for a possible downgrade . a lower rating could hamper enron ' s core trading businesses .
behind the worries among these agencies , in part , is the loss of investor confidence , which one of the rating companies , fitch , said in a report last week could impair "" enron ' s financial flexibility and access to capital markets , therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business . ""
the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on "" essentially the same terms "" as they have in the past . "" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , "" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances .
the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said .
bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . "" confidence in this company was lost , "" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . "" but confidence will be restored . ""
corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling .

manager ' s journal : how enron ran out of gas

is troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern .
a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled .
not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers .
the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy .
but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a "" new economy "" web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then .
then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight .
it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad .
not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter .
enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march 2000 10 - k , a "" senior officer of enron is the managing member "" of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron "" manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . "" it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund .
there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done .
as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers .
to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 .
we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency .
where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves .

enron seeks additional financing

dallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today .
last week , enron , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it .
enron ' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company ' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . ' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said .
two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting .
enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating .

enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue .
more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar .
mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders .
janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn .
the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january .
most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are "" dated "" , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed .
morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been "" lightening up "" their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when .
ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been "" trimmed substantially "" .
other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund .

comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty .
enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind .
its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these "" related - party transactions "" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed .
with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity .
"" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , "" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank .
on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "" new economy "" magic on to old economy companies .
enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading .
for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it .
the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets .
the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : "" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . ""
the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a "" loose - tight "" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets .
up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years .
balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : "" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . ""
this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company .
it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider .
in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing .
in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation .
a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . "" they went after too many things too quickly , "" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency .
a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed .
david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : "" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . ""
the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . "" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , "" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . ""
enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise .
"" they over - promised on the new business they created , "" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . "" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . ""
will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets .
and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

enron , the troubled us energy group , was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price .
the houston - based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence - building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among us investors .
last week the company raised $ 3 . 3 bn ( euros 3 . 7 bn ) in cash to bolster its financial position but enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance . the company insisted , however , that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong .
mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "" establish additional lines of liquidity "" . "" once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up , that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest , "" mr palmer said .
the company ' s problems have become public since an announcement on october 16 that it would take a $ 1 . 01 bn special charge and write down shareholders ' equity by another $ 1 . 2 bn . the moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , who was forced to take a leave of absence last week .
enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the october 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically "" junk "" status , though its official ratings are still investment grade .
"" our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations , "" said raymond niles of salomon smith barney . "" these activities require at least an investment grade credit rating , or enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements . ""
the controversy over enron ' s balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the securities and exchange commission . enron flickers , page 22 .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 26 ( reuters ) - last year , enron corp . was a darling of investors and analysts , but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings .
enron , trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company ' s complex financial transactions , has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week .
but the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the united states is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases .
while enron ' s problems differ from more traditional utilities , many other power producers are returning to their roots . they are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy .
paul patterson , an energy analyst with abn amro , said there are common themes affecting the industry .
"" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , "" patterson said .
as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off .
shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday .
the world has changed
aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets .
"" it ' s a different place , "" aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company .
"" the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , "" said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman .
return to traditional values
bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business .
it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise .
"" calpine does it already , "" he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . "" what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , "" he added .
howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies .
smaller companies also rethink strategies
as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line .
"" earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . "" said patterson .
michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america .
cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments .
allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings .
the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time .
"" the company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders , "" allegheny said .

new york ( afx ) - enron corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line , a spokesman told the wall street journal .
the company is in talks to raise between 1 - 2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days , it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying .
the deal , which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence , would supplement existing lines . these are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears .
enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer , andrew fastow .

the paper said that an enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but could not supply any further details .
confidence in enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships . its stock has tumbled amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into the company ' s ousted chief financial officer ' s links to some of the partnerships .

tokyo , oct 29 ( reuters ) - japan ' s major polyester manufacturer , teijin ltd , said on monday it would conduct a feasibility study with u . s . energy giant enron corp on building a coal - fired power plant .
teijin said in a statement that it and e power corp , a japanese affiliate of enron corp , would look into building the 70 , 000 kilowatt coal - burning thermal power plant in matsuyama , ehime prefecture , on the southwestern island of shikoku , where teijin has a polyester plant .
"" we are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants , with eyes on further deregulation in japan ' s power market , "" a teijin spokesman said .
japan is in the process of deregulating its power market . since march last year , large - lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers .
in its polyester business , teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production , a trend which would leave it with surplus power . it is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus .
the two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of teijin ' s existing power generator in matsuyama , teijin said . it hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of enron .
enron corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in japan .
the teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by june 2002 .
teijin ' s shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2 . 68 percent at 472 yen .

once - mighty enron strains under scrutiny

is time running out for enron ?
at the beginning of this year , the enron corporation , the world ' s dominant energy trader , appeared unstoppable . the company ' s decade - long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from california to new york . its ties to the bush administration assured that its views would be heard in washington . its sales , profits and stock were soaring .
and under the leadership of jeffrey k . skilling , its chief executive , enron ' s arrogance had grown even more quickly .
the company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets .
' ' we are on the side of angels , ' ' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california ' s energy crisis . ' ' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it ' s the american way . ' '
but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting .
some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value .
enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day .
the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company .
the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached .
enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas .
the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch .
the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash .
enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide .
the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year .
philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations .
' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' '
in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company .
a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits .
enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades .
' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo .
for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 .
' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said .
still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation .
mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business .
but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements .
now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask .
to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances .
the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference .
deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships .
enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report .
the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose .
in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors .
mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company .
in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '
mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year .
in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming .
david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call .
to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume .
' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' '
but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years .
now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy .
' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' '
' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said .
short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say .
' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' '
james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits .
even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy .
' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist .
in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission .
enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices .
large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states .
before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power .
beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business .
the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' '
for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement .
enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that .
enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not .
enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound .
but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight .

plumbing mystery of deals by enron

at the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the enron corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , beginning in the summer of 1999 . because they were transactions among related parties , the company was required to disclose them , but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered . following are some questions that investors are asking , and the currently available answers .
q . why did enron enter into the deals ?
a . enron ' s first disclosures , in 1999 , gave no reason . in later reports , it said it was seeking to ' ' hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , ' ' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies .
q . how did those investments do ?
a . it looks as if they plunged in value , although there is no clear disclosure on that .
q . why can ' t that be discerned ?
a . the company never said just what the investments were . and the transactions with the partnerships were complicated , involving a variety of derivative securities , enron stock and various promissory notes . enron ' s financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely .
q . why were they so complicated ?
a . one reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage . one accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock . if a company sells its shares at $ 10 each and then buys them back - - whether for $ 1 or $ 50 - - there is no gain or loss . but shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in , or paid out , on the transactions . enron ' s transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule .
q . who made money from these transactions ?
a . enron reported some profits along the way from the deals , although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings . and it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors .
q . if the deals began in 1999 , why all the uproar now ?
a . many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well . as long as enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter , they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important .
q . when were concerns raised with enron ?
a . the complaints grew as enron ' s share price fell earlier this year . by this summer , enron decided that mr . fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships . then , because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to enron , the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions . but investors were still worried , and enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships .
q . how did enron do ?
a . badly . it took a $ 35 million loss , which , given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken , was not very much . but it also reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
q . how did that happen ?
a . that , like so much else , is not clear . but it looks as if the partnership owed enron that much money , could not pay and was let off the hook by enron . in return , enron terminated ' ' previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods . ' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings .
q . is that legal under the accounting rules ?
a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris

investors seem to ignore discouraging news

investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor .
the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 .
investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent .
all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates .
the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 .

itc says imports hurt steel industry
the international trade commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry , paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with europe and asia .
the independent u . s . agency has until mid - december to provide the white house with a list of proposed remedies , which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel .
beleaguered u . s . steelmakers applauded the decision .
president bush , who instigated the itc investigation , is expected to approve the protective measures , though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks .

shares of enron plummet amid losses
enron corp . ' s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders ' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some enron assets .
the stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by wall street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles .
two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves , and several analysts lowered their recommendations on enron .
enron has reiterated that its finances are strong . and although analysts note that enron ' s core businesses remain sound , some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems .
to mollify investors , enron replaced its chief financial officer , who until recently headed the two partnerships the sec is eyeing .

houston is known as the "" energy capital of the world . "" and a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate . houston skyscrapers bearing the names of enron , chevron , exxon and shell make significant contributions to the view .
now another name is being added to the downtown mix , enhancing the energy capital image even further . the 36 - story two allen center has been renamed devon energy tower .
devon energy has just signed a lease for 193 , 000 square feet of space , more than doubling its presence in the building , and as part of the deal , devon gets to put its name on the structure .
the lease also gives oklahoma city - based devon the right to take more space in the 1 million - square - foot building , at 1212 smith st .
devon recently announced its plans to acquire mitchell energy & development , but it will maintain mitchell ' s offices in the woodlands , said klay kimker , manager of office administration for devon .
kevin snodgrass and tim relyea of cushman & wakefield represented devon in the transaction . paul frazier and margaret sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of trizechahn office properties , the owner of the building .
trizechahn owns both the allen center and cullen center office complexes , a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown . the trizechahn office space is nearly full right now , but enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby enron building is complete .
teamsters to build facilities
teamsters union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the katy freeway .
to replace the katy freeway building , the union expects to build two smaller structures near bush intercontinental airport to house different chapters , said a . w . parker , secretary treasurer of local 968 .
parker ' s group is expecting to build a 13 , 000 - square - foot building at ella boulevard at beltway 8 .
another teamsters group has purchased 4 . 5 acres on beltway 8 at diplomatic plaza drive , in the world houston business center . the land was purchased from the licha family trust . tony patronella and marc drumwright , both of southwest realty advisors , handled the sale .
chicago firm buying property
a chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in houston .
ml capital ventures has purchased two small office structures : the 71 , 736 - square - foot building at 5500 northwest central drive and the 66 , 338 - square - foot building at 5301 hollister . the building on northwest central drive is the headquarters of bj services energy company .
mike luecht , president of ml capital , said his firm will acquire two additional houston office buildings before the end of the year .
ml capital , which has been in business for eight months , will exceed luecht ' s initial plan to buy more than $ 22 million worth of suburban office space in houston in the company ' s start - up phase .
luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate : buying warehouses in chicago and buying office buildings in suburban houston . houston ' s economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors , luecht said . many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of houston realty market in the 1980 s , luecht said .
in its most recent deal , ml ventures bought the 5500 northwest central building in partnership with avgeris & associates of chicago . tom bousquet of cb richard ellis brokered the deal .

enron taps all its credit lines to buy back $ 3 . 3 billion of debt
by floyd norris

c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation , trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity , began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday , using $ 3 . 3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit .
an enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $ 1 billion in cash .
the moves did not appear to reassure investors , as enron ' s share price fell to another six - year low . shares traded as low as $ 15 . 04 yesterday , before ending the day at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents .
the move will raise the interest expense for the company , because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market , and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $ 1 billion .
enron ' s debt is rated investment grade . but its bonds now trade below investment grade levels , although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default . but with the bonds trading so low , it is unlikely enron will be able to sell more commercial paper .
enron ' s stock has been plunging since oct . 17 , shortly after it disclosed that its third - quarter balance sheet , which has yet to be released , will show a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by andrew fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was replaced on wednesday .
the stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement , and the company has disclosed that the securities and exchange commission has asked questions about its accounting practices .

enron , the houston - based energy trading group , continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted .
investor confidence in enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off - balance sheet structure . the securities and exchange commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company ' s finances .
enron ' s five - year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11 . 13 per cent , down from 83 cents on thursday . bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy .
late on thursday , enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch .
commercial paper financing , which normally has to be rolled every 90 days , is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis .
"" what they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business , "" said robin west , chairman of the petroleum finance company , the industry consultants . "" in a situation like this , cash is king . ""
enron ' s biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties , such as duke energy and reliant resources , start asking it for more collateral , increasing the cost of its everyday business .
if enron were downgraded to junk , the counterparties could do just that .
so far , credit rating analysts say , enron ' s core business is holding up well . but their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal .
enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting , but its most recent problems stem from the ljm private equity fund run by andy fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer .
enron compensated its partners in this complex off - balance sheet structure by promising to give them enron shares , if the value of private equity investments in the new power company , technology and other things fell below a certain level .
those investments fell $ 1 . 2 bn in value from the threshold level , which should have triggered the issue of 62 m shares if the deal had not been reversed .
the complex deal was designed to make sure enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that jp morgan chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market .

houston ( ap ) - after enron corp . tapped into more than $ 3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers , stock prices dropped .
enron corp . ' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday . shares fell 95 cents on friday to $ 15 . 40 , a level not seen since 1995 , as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company ' s earnings announcement earlier this month .
the stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks , and the company lost almost $ 14 billion in market value .
late this week the company decided to convert $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash . the company put about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $ 2 . 2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short - term corporate iou known as commercial paper .
"" nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week .
palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "" good management decisions . ""
on oct . 16 enron ' s third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest .
the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron .
fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise .
the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence .
reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan .
"" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin told the houston chronicle for saturday ' s editions .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing .
"" just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , "" she said . "" do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . ""

houston - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 - billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans .
the company ' s stock has fallen 54 % in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 % , to $ 15 . 40 on the new york stock exchange .
investors said chief executive kenneth lay has failed to reassure them that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
"" do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , "" said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . "" people are questioning the credibility of management . ""
the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said .
the price of enron ' s 6 . 75 % bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 11 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of bbb + , yield 9 . 53 % .
investors have grown concerned that the firm ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions .
enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was "" a smart financial move , "" said stephen moore of moody ' s investors service . "" it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ""

enron ' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest .
the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company ' s newer businesses such as broadband trading .
fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise .
the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence .
now enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms .
"" to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , "" said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan .
but reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , he said .
"" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin said .

"" do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . ""
jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned .
in a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron ' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it .
"" thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , "" dietert wrote in a report friday . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . ""
feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store .
for example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets .
chewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron ' s global equity markets group .

enron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service .
the companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron ' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas .
qwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn .
on oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn ' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project ' s first phase .
the lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest .
enron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was "" confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron . ""

how to lose a war
by frank rich

c . 2001 new york times company
welcome back to sept . 10 .
the ' ' america strikes back ' ' optimism that surged after sept . 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we ' re losing the war at home . the f . b . i . has proved more effective in waging turf battles against rudy giuliani than waging war on terrorism . of the more than 900 suspects arrested , exactly zero have been criminally charged in the world trade center attack ( though one has died of natural causes , we ' re told , in a new jersey jail cell ) . the bush team didn ' t fully recognize that a second attack on america had begun until more than a week after the first casualty . the most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists - - tom ridge ' s announcement that ' ' the site where the letters were mailed ' ' had been found in new jersey - - proved a dead end . and now the president is posing with elementary - school children again .
given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with c . e . o . clockwork , perhaps it should be added to the growing list of things that have changed forever since sept . 11 . but let ' s not be so hasty . not everything changes that fast - - least of all washington . the white house ' s home - front failures are not sudden , unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since jan . 20 .
this is an administration that will let its special interests - - particularly its high - rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right - - have veto power over public safety , public health and economic prudence in war , it turns out , no less than in peacetime . when anthrax struck , the administration ' s first impulse was not to secure as much cipro as speedily as possible to protect americans , but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer . the white house ' s faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week ' s house ' ' stimulus ' ' package showering $ 254 million on enron , the reeling houston energy company ( now under s . e . c . investigation ) that has served as a bush campaign cash machine .
airport security , which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since sept . 11 , is also held hostage by campaign cash : as salon has reported , servicemaster , a supplier of the low - wage employees who ineptly man the gates , is another g . o . p . donor . not that republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first . in a display of bipartisanship , democrats - - lobbied by linda hall daschle , the senate majority leader ' s wife - - joined the administration in handing the airlines a $ 15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry ' s c . e . o . ' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees .
to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge .
mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today .
the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern .
pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist .
it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag .
as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' '
ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) .
if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion .
the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment .
since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . ' '
maybe we ' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can ' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it ' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff .

city - enron directors cash in shares .
by simon english .
10 / 27 / 2001
the daily telegraph

( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001
leading executives at enron , the troubled us energy giant , cashed in shares worth more than $ 100 m ( # 70 m ) this year in the run - up to a financial crunch that has left the company ' s credibility in ruins .
research by thomson financial shows that kenneth lay , chief executive , sold about 400 , 000 shares this year , netting him more than $ 25 m . he still held 2 . 8 m shares until july .
other executives made similar sales , a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $ 83 at the start of the year to $ 45 by july . they halved again this week and fell to below $ 16 yesterday . enron declined to comment on the share sales .
mr lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "" dispel uncertainty in the financial community "" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in enron ' s financial strength . enron will pay off debts of $ 2 . 2 billion and keep another $ 800 , 000 in cash . he said : "" we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community . ""
the company is facing an inquiry by the securities & exchange commission into partnerships managed by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer .
mr fastow was ousted on wednesday night as part of the company ' s moves to restore confidence , though enron insists he has done nothing wrong .
enron lost $ 1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "" failed investments "" .

india : lenders to meet over enron ' s dabhol on nov 3 .
10 / 27 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
bombay , oct 27 ( reuters ) - lenders to power plant in india majority owned by enron corp have called a meeting next week in london to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project , a banking source said on saturday .
they will examine offers that two indian companies have put forward for buying the u . s . energy giant ' s 65 percent stake , and those of two other u . s . firms , in dabhol power company ( dpc ) , which is building the controversial project , the source told reuters .
the meeting of lenders , who include multinational banks such as citibank and bank of america , will be held on november 3 , the source added .
at stake is not just the fate of the $ 2 . 9 billion , 2 , 184 mw project , which is india ' s largest foreign direct investment , but also the over $ 600 million investment of enron , general electric co and bechtel .
all three companies are founders of dpc , which in 1995 got permission from india ' s maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast .
the plant ' s first phase of 740 mw was completed in 1999 , but work on the second phase of 1 , 444 mw , which is 97 percent complete , was abruptly stopped in june this year following a blazing row with cash - strapped state utility mseb .
mseb , which agreed in 1995 to take the plant ' s entire output , said it can no longer do so because dabhol ' s power is too costly .
dabhol , in turn , accused mseb of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract .
under this notice , both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations . if talks fail , dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in london . that six month period expires on november 19 .
houston - based enron , which owns 65 percent of dabhol , further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the indian government .
time running out
the business standard newspaper reported that next week ' s meeting would also discuss a request by dabhol to finally terminate the contract after november 19 .
"" it is one of the items on the agenda , "" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying .
the paper said once dabhol serves the final notice , the matter proceeds to arbitration , which would not help india .
"" the widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation dpc will win hands down , "" the paper added .
a dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately .
the source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far .
the indian government has not responded to enron ' s offer to buy its equity , but two indian companies , bses ltd and tata power ltd , have shown interest .
they have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced , and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount .
local business daily , the economic times reported on friday that tata power and bses are willing to pay the founders $ 450 - $ 600 million for the 85 percent stake held by enron , ge and bechtel .
enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $ 1 billion , the paper added .
officials of tata power and bses were not immediately available for comment .

houston - - enron has sued microsoft , alleging it breached a contract for broadband services , in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company ' s msn high - speed internet service in some u . s . regions .
microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in the 14 states - - including washington - - where qwest communications international operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
enron ' s lawsuit was filed thursday , the same day microsoft had planned to offer fast internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is making a push to win customers from aol time warner .
"" we are trying to resolve the issues with enron , as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers , "" visse said .
enron spokeswoman karen denne declined to comment on the lawsuit , citing company policy on pending litigation . enron , based in houston , is the largest energy trader .
enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow jones news wire reported .
enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal , dow reported .
alternative browser - users denied microsoft entry
new york - - microsoft ' s premier web portal , msn . com , denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as opera and told them to get microsoft ' s products instead .
the decision led to complaints from the small but loyal opera community that microsoft was abusing its status as the internet ' s browser leader . microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all .
browser products affected by the shutout , which was triggered by a face - lift of the msn . com web site , included opera , mozilla and amaya , said kevin reichard , editorial manager for internet . com ' s browserwatch site .
mike pettit , president of procomp , an anti - microsoft group , urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing microsoft of anti - competitive practices .

microsoftsf to shut down ; sony will run retail store
san francisco - - sony will take over a retail store it manages with microsoft next month , when the biggest software maker ' s xbox goes up against sony ' s playstation 2 in a contest for control of the $ 20 billion video - game market , a sony spokeswoman said .
the two companies agreed to shut down microsoftsf , a retail outlet in sony ' s san francisco metreon entertainment complex . it will be replaced with a digital solutions electronics store run by sony on thursday , metreon spokeswoman kirsten maynard said .
in april 1998 , the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells microsoft products alongside sony electronics that run the software . in march 2000 , microsoft announced the xbox , a game console with an advanced - graphics chip that goes on sale nov . 15 .
"" a lot has changed with both companies , "" maynard said . "" it sort of became not - a - fit anymore . ""
sony metreon won ' t carry the xbox or game cube , a new video console from nintendo that goes on sale nov . 19 , she said . officials at microsoft couldn ' t be reached for comment on the shutdown .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

if you can wait a week or so , we can have the first of a regularly - scheduled update / report .
accounting ( jody pierce ) is getting the book set up consistent with the memo . the contracts have been copied up to portland and sf . in a week or so , we will have a report that shows balance and some qualitative metrics , i . e . who we are talking with , indicative bids , project opportunities , etc . for example , we included the mitsubishis in the roseville permit application which is being filed on july 31 . we are passing on the pge turbine for now - they seem content to try to sell on their own .

with the shipment of two of the four units from mhi scheduled for august and no viable place to ship them , our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly . we need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position .
based on discussion with a number of people , i would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible . john garrison has identified a number of potential buyers , and i believe that brett wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak .
we should inform mhi that we will now target unit 3 for fort pierce , given the slowdown in the fort pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from mhi on unit 1 . if we also drop the dual fuel requirement for fort pierce , we should provide some project savings to that project . prior to informing mhi , we shoud have jackson chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs .
i also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for tallahassee , unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3 rd unit to a buyer . in the next three weeks we will review tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project .
finally , mhi has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from august 2 to the end of august . i think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly , given that we can ' t tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an august 2 ship date . we should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date .
probably everyone knows some of this , and some know all of this , but hopefully the overall picture is of value .
thanks !

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

3399,fw : 30 th floor after move,"i need the following . . . . . . . .
assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to it connection issues or problems with the building itself ( ac , power , etc . ) . if we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30 th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side . obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely . one approach is to take the edi pipes and have them go to the 30 th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home . using this approach , and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30 th floor . i ' m open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them . i need this by friday 7 / 27 no later than noon .

subject : 30 th floor after move
during the first six months after the move to the new building , it has recommended that the 30 th floor be maintained in case of any emergency .
what we have to do is come up with the list of critical personnel . there will be very limited seating ,
these should be just the people to finish the day when ever that happens .
let ' s get together tomorrow and discuss .

i would like you to put me in contact with s / one at enron here in london that
deals with weather derivatives and would be in a position to sell us options on
weather derivatives ( temperature , cat ) . let me know if you are able to do that
or if i need to work internally here in order to find out whom we have contacts
with at enron .
if you want to call me my direct line is + 44 207 336 - 2836 . alternatively i could
call you but do bear in mind that i leave the office around 6 : 30 - 7 pm london

5512,energy book,"hi grant ,
hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail
that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has
cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .
i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is
there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my
request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter ?
i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed
slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .
many thanks and best regards .

2 overview of this book
this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book .
in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean
reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .
chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and
trade .
chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves . what we do in this chapter
chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors
and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or
average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .
chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form
solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps .
chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is
developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style
options .
chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a
multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are
developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo
schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of american style options .
chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .
in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also
discussed .
chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after
discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs
( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,
delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we
look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market
variables .",-1

this is a note we should send to john , richard , joe and michael - explaining
how we are going to justify the program beyond our current agreement in
principal !
we should go back to them with 1 and 2 reasonably quickly ( joe and richard
will be big buyers of 1 at least )
introduction
enron is expanding rapidly and continuing to grow , both in its current
business and in acquiring new business lines
this has highlighted a number of problems , not least of which is the lack of
transparency in the underlying cost structure within enron
we need to focus on the root causes of these costs rather than the symptoms .
objectives
current costbase - we need to establish each business units ' end to end
direct support costs . see spreadsheet below an example - worksheet "" e 2 e
direct support headcount ""
model of costbase as we move forward - we need to develop a cost model that
will provide
a qualitative description of the cost drivers within the organisation , which
answers
what are we doing - what are the key activities / functions within each
business unit and functions across all business units
why are we doing this - what are the main cost / activity drivers for carrying
out these activities / functions
what headcount cost is attributable to each activity / function - establish a
quantitative cost measure
we need to be able to report on current operational leverage and efficiency
ratios
efficiency ratio - what is the percentage of rework for each
activity / function - implies an estimate of how far we are from stp process
operational leverage - ratio of headcount increase to activity increase
use costbase model to predict quantifiable benefits - using headcount cost
data and ratios
we need to understand how many quick hits will accrue from business process
changes to current environment - impact on efficiency ratio
we need to understand how functionality developments will change required
headcount cost - impact on operational leverage ratio
investment cost - the specific costs associated with changing the operating
platform
development costs - people [ and hardware ]
business analysts  , time
line management time
user time ( including time for uat )
consulting costs
[ opportunity cost ]
prepare cost benefit analysis - use 3 and 4
identify qualitative benefits
reduction in operating risk - process will be exception based with up front
controls
reduction in number of operational errors
trading errors that should be charged to the middle office
client costs
funding errors
mo and it support base focused on value adding tasks
more effective management .
better management information .
quicker identification of exceptions should leader to quicker resolution .
people benefits - increased job satisfaction as processes are now more
investigative
improved control standards as standard processes will stretch across all
businesses .
eliminates costs and difficulty of maintaining various systems , e . g .
spreadsheets .
easier to cross train staff and provide cover .
utilise all information above to calculate an actual and target unit cost per
transaction ( vanilla and complex ) and monitor as key success factor from
progam
the spreadsheet below shows what we should be looking to complete - worksheet
"" costs model input "" . we need to do this by product - one spreadsheet per
product

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

executive summary
? northwest smelters jockey for favorable rates
? bc hydro ' s rate freeze lingers
? bpa rates expected to rise , california refunds doubtful
aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s )
on 1 october 2001 the long - term relationship between dsi ' s and bpa for preferred rates will end as bonneville power administration ' s new rate case takes effect . after 2001 , dsi ' s become discretionary customers of bonneville power administration . dsi ' s have been playing the game of slowly ' migrating ' their load to local utilities in 9 . 9 mw annual increments to avoid being subject to bonneville ' s new large single load ( nlsl ) designation and losing their preferred rate status . now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto bpa ' s federal system , and officials at bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own nlsl regulations , which were established in 1980 . in an effort to secure existing dsi relationships , bpa is now undertaking a review of its nlsl regulation to provide an exemption for these companies .
bpa is opposed by the public power council , the representative of the public utilities in the pacific northwest that focuses bpa rate - making , which has sent a letter to the assistant secretary of energy to express its objections to bpa ' s proposed actions . the ppc was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the dsi ' s as large industrial customers - they are moving aggressively to block bpa from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment .
the ability of bpa to exempt dsi ' s from its nlsl regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region . it remains to be seen whether or not the public power council will initiate a legal battle to stop the dsi ' s from obtaining this special treatment .
while moving to maintain positive relationships with the dsi ' s , bpa is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish . bpa has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter - they won ' t really benefit much , even from normal or better precipitation , until the melt starts next april . bpa wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then . about the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money they ' re getting from bpa to subsidize power purchases on the spot market . however , there would be a lot of risk in that , and bpa people don ' t think market prices would enable them to be very profitable , even with the bpa money helping .
as of april 1 , three smelters should come back on line ; nw aluminum , goldendale aluminum , longville aluminum
? alcoa aluminum
there is not much news happening on the negotiating end between alcoa and bc hydro right now . information is still fairly tight - lipped , however , employees of alcoa ' s idled intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart . this may indicate the direction of negotiations .
? kaiser aluminum
as odd man out , kaiser has little to say in northwestern energy developments . the company will obviously benefit if bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities , but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again , though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time .
british columbia politics
? bc government
the latest news from british columbia is that the bc liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy . public opinion remains quite high , and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first 90 - day period . even former ndp legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding . political strategists are watching the anwr vote in the us very carefully , not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through northern bc , but also because it is illustrating the environment vs . labor fallout . in the recent election , the green party of british columbia performed surprisingly well , garnering around 12 % of the vote in any typical race , contributing directly to the downfall of the ndp .
premier gordon campbell ' s core review of bc government is due by october , and it appears that the process will be primarily a cost - cutting measure . they are moving to reduce expenditures , which for bc hydro ' s sake , will include community outreach , student scholarship and any other ' feel good ' programs currently being undertaken by hydro .
the real long - term policy planning , however , is expected to take place in january when campbell ' s team ( brenda eaton , the deputy premiere ; doug allen , the premiere ' s consultant ; and jack ebbels , deputy energy minister ) works in conjunction with neufeld to construct bc ' s long - term energy plan .
bc hydro
bc hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the rto west regional transmission organization as a filing utility . rto west is currently being overseen by the western governor ' s association and developed as allowed by ferc . rto west will be the oversight entity in the western states and canada that will manage electricity transmission issues . we are also expecting alberta to come on board rto west shortly .
with regard to a potential rate hearing , bc hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until 2003 . the word on this move is that it will allow chairman bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business , such as transmission and information technology - focusing bc hydro ' s core operations on additional generation , exports / trading , and delivery . the public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket , similar to what happened in california - but bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze .
as a function of increasing bc hydro ' s generation capacity , they are looking very carefully at building on two sites : site c ( hydroelectric dam ) and burrard thermal .
bpa
? financial status
in what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters , bpa dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the fb crac on 1 october . this would increase rates over the 46 % lb crac rate increase announced earlier - - despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary . what this essentially does is allow bpa to bypass its initial rate case increase of 46 % , utilizing a stop - gap measure under federal regulations .
bpa cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an fb crac , including losses trading power this summer , changes in the accounting treatment of some dsi buyouts , and uncertainty whether the california iso and px can pay monies owed bpa . bpa did note , however , that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the fb crac calculation . if the fb crac triggers by any amount , bpa would have the option of "" truing up "" its calculation of the fb crac in march and could change the rates again if bpa ' s actual financial condition on 30 september differs from what is estimated now , or if bpa changes its accounting assumptions further .
bpa representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier load - based crac increase ( of about 46 % ) - - "" much less than 20 % , and probably much , much less than 20 % . ""
the public power council staff has written to and met with steve wright , bpa acting administrator , in an effort to convince bpa that a fc crac is unnecessary . we should know bpa ' s decision by 31 august .
? ferc refunds
at this time , bpa will not seek refunds in the ongoing ferc proceedings - or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against bpa - for the following reasons :
1 ) bpa believes ferc lacks jurisdiction over bpa .
2 ) the proceedings are so convoluted ( and the transactions so complicated ) that bpa asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds . insofar as other parties collecting against bpa , in some cases bpa was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of , for example , aluminum smelters . ferc would have to proceed against these third parties , and often that money has already been spent .
3 ) with respect to claims by the calif . dwr ( $ 71 million ) , a similar claim in the separate california ferc proceeding was disallowed on 14 june . it would be incongruous to allow the claim here . in this claim , ferc denied dwr access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller .
4 ) then there are the assorted politics involved . first , bpa believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received . bpa calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa $ 400 million , while it believes its own potential claims could amount to $ 500 million - thus a potential $ 100 million net gain . for reasons cited , however , we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds . second , with respect to others seeking refunds against bpa , five nw senators who sit on the senate energy committee would be very upset if ferc allowed california parties to collect against bpa ; and ferc to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment .
bpa is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a 10 % chance of their being forced to submit to ferc in this matter . of course , if they were forced to submit to ferc jurisdiction , they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds .
even if bpa received refunds , we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back on - line . we anticipate that on 1 april 2002 , three smelters ( amounting to between 300 - 500 mw ) will come back on line : northwest aluminum & goldendale aluminum ( 230 mw ) , and longville aluminum ( 100 mw ) .
? spill - related issues
fish returns for this year have been especially high . if the ocean stays productive for the next few years , as some think it might , the region could have an enormous opportunity to rebuild the salmon and steelhead runs and make huge strides towards success in this area .
behind - the - scenes work continues on the implementation plan ( on the biological opinion on the hydro system ) , with the region ' s states and tribes trying to play a stronger role in designing the columbia river strategy .
ppc and northwest irrigation utilities were admitted to the national wildlife federation et al v . nmfs lawsuit as defendant interveners , and the court is now making plans to try mediation between the parties .",-1

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

that this material is only one part of what needs to be happening in your
neon group . ? the getting to know and share with each other is critical - - use
one of the icebreaker activities you have ( even if it seems cheesy ) or
somehow ask questions and get the group talking with each other or about
themselves .
?
see the note above the material about the cd in your neon box .
?
finally , i haven ' t let you know about the new leaders we have working with
us , specifically with carol poe and the backors in neon silver - - leslie and
debbie bills ! ? welcome debbie and les !
?
keep up the great work !

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

oh dear !
i thought it was all straight . ebl 931 was my room on the original floor
plan ,
but somehow they changed the numbers . we were all packed , everything
was ready for the move and i just happened to come to the 19 th floor the
day of the move and noticed that they had renumbered all of the rooms !
the move team hurredly put stickers ( with the old numbers ) on the doors
of each room .
i am now in eb 1961 . vince kaminski is in 1962 . if you need the names

subject : wholesale and retail power systems
about a month ago i held a meeting in houston to bring together the systems , operations , and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems . there were probably twenty people there , including beth perlman , anthony dayao , beth appollo , bob hall , leslie reeves , lloyd will , todd busby , greg woulfe , rogers herndon , murray o ' neil , steve nat , jeff richter , thresa allen , pablo ? , mark pickering , dale furrow , and many more .
two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting . first , it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos . beth ' s group was just starting to talk to anthony ' s group . the site profile team wasn ' t on the same page as richter who wasn ' t necessarily in sync with herndon . ees and ena ( and for that matter east ena and west ena ) volume management and rto settlements people weren ' t talking to one another . second , it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together . we tasked todd busby , debra bailey , and lloyd will to spend a month talking to each group and "" drawing the picture "" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together . they brought in a couple of people from accenture to assist with this project .
the powerpoint presentation below documents their findings . i would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations . here are the highlights :
power it and operations remain organizationally divided between wholesale and retail
settlements development efforts are not global
create one power it & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading , risk , settlements busby , todd ; richter , jeff
subject : version 5 - small tweaks only ( not required )

i made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out :

however , i did locate :
real time operations : ectpdx - lnl / ect \ realtime \ myaccoun . nsf ( would this be the correct database ? )
realtime : ecthou - ln 7 / ect \ mail \ realtime . nsf
for wscc outages and west realtime databases , if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following :
close the database icon
right - click on the database icon
choose file , database , properties
then send me the title , server , and filename information . this will be of great help .

subject : bnycp litigation analysis : privileged and confidential
attached are the memoranda prepared by outside counsel assessing the bnycp litigation . to avoid as much confusion as possible , i suggest reading the andrews & kurth memo first , the bernstein memo second and the risk matrix last .
in a nutshell , all agree that this is a very fact intensive case and that there has been little factual discovery to date . it is also agreed that we have been denied the benefit of some of the evidence available as a result of the confidentiality obligations in place . accordingly , much of the analysis provided is really counsel ' s "" best guess "" based on the information available .
that being said , there seems to be a general agreement that , based on the facts currently available and the "" quick and dirty "" analysis that we have been able to do , the exposure ranges from approximately $ 20 to $ 50 million . interest and attorney fees could also prove significant .
i am available to discuss this further if you think that would be helpful . thanks for your patience .",-1

kansas city business journal  ) 09 / 29 / 2000
by brian cookson
utilicorp united inc . wants to parlay the rapid growth of its aquila energy
subsidiary into a piece of a new , larger aquila .
the kansas city - based utility has plans to spin off aquila , possibly
retaining ownership of a third of it , selling another third to a partner and
offering the remainder in the stock market . the move could allow aquila , now
engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas , to gain more hard assets
of its own and seek higher valuation from investors .
 & we really think the value of our company is much higher than the market
currently values it because it values it as a utility ,  8 aquila spokesman al
butkus said .
aquila , which moved its headquarters to kansas city last year , has been the
engine behind earnings growth for utilicorp . for the second quarter of this
year , aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes ( ebit ) of $ 49 . 5
million , up 113 percent from the previous year . utilicorp as a whole had
ebit of $ 103 . 9 million for the second quarter of 2000 .
aquila may be able to attract more interest because it wouldn  , t carry the
image of a traditional utility , butkus said .
richard stuebi , president of next wave energy , agreed . the head of the
denver - based electricity consulting firm said wall street historically has
undervalued conglomerates such as utilicorp .
 & in general , the stock market prefers companies that are clean or pure
plays ,  8 stuebi said .
aquila  , s strategy comes as little surprise to stuebi . as much success as the
company has had , he said he thought aquila would need to get bigger to
compete .
 & in most aspects of the energy business , the race for scale is on ,  8 he said .
aquila also could increase its value to shareholders by looking for hard
assets to match its marketing prowess . aquila ceo keith stamm said the
company could address this need by building , such as the new electric
generation plant it is building in pleasant hill . it also could buy
generation capacity or take on a partner with electric generation capacity .
stamm said the company is looking for such a partner but is keeping the other
two options open . finding a partner with power plants could become easier as
energy deregulation causes many utilities to look at separating generating
operations from power sales and distribution .
stamm said that aquila has talked to several companies and that an
announcement could come by the end of the year .
the timing of any initial public stock offering would be dependent on the
results of the search for a partner .
butkus said utilicorp isn  , t sacrificing its hold on aquila . instead ,
executives are hoping to own part of an infinitely more valuable company .
aquila already is moving to enter a new market  ) trading bandwidth , or
capacity on communications networks . stamm said the bandwidth market is
potentially several times larger than the energy market because
communications networks can be linked by satellite to anywhere in the world .
gas pipelines require a physical connection .
traders in the bandwidth market could include telecom companies or internet
providers that either have network capacity to sell or that need to boost
their capacity .
 & we like to see volatility , and we  , re seeing it ,  8 stamm said .
aquila is adding a crew of 35 to 40 people to begin trading bandwidth by the
end of the year . it won  , t be alone , however , as companies such as houston  , s
enron corp . also are getting into bandwidth trading .

dear lance ,
the university is predicting a shortfall due to increased
gas costs of between $ 30 and $ 40 million , over the next 1 to 2
years . for a long time , i have been wanting to explore opportunities for
the
campus to sell energy to austin energy when its load is below
peak . this big shortfall provides an impetus for the university
to want to maximize the value of its plant .

6269,pac enrollment,"last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to
become a "" million dollar pac "" . enron employees , who provide all of the
funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,
becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new
challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal
employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please
join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution .
the enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
policy . our pac funds support local , state and federal candidates , of both
parties , who support open markets , deregulation and customer choice . amounts
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal
election campaign act . while our pac has grown thanks to our employee
contributions , it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
those who oppose these ideals .
this year , as always , we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
our businesses , including such issues as taxation and regulation of
e - commerce , electric industry restructuring , regulation of derivatives ,
international trade and investment legislation , pipeline safety , local and
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
a variety of environmental and tax issues . enron has a long and successful
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy . that track
record depends on access to and regular communication with , decision makers .
the pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
about what they are doing .
one of the best things about enron is that we don  , t just take things as they
are . we challenge the status quo . we ask why . we change things . the pac
helps us do that . we need you to help the pac . sign up today - and please
consider the following contribution guidelines :
manager $ 500 / year
director $ 750 / year
sr . director / general manager $ 1 , 000 / year
vice president $ 2 , 500 / year
sr . vp / managing director $ 3 , 500 / year
executive committee $ 5 , 000 / year
all contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions .
you are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and
enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their
contribution or their decision not to contribute . you may refuse to
contribute without fear of reprisal .
only u . s . citizens and resident - aliens living in the u . s . can contribute to
the enron pac . the maximum contribution is $ 5 , 000 per year per individual .
an individual may not contribute more than $ 25 , 000 to all federal candidates
and committees within a calendar year . the law requires that enron report
name , address , employer and occupation for every person who contributes over
$ 200 / year .
no portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for
federal income tax purposes .
thanks for your support ! sign up now , or revise your current contribution
level by connecting with the pac intranet site :

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

happy to help with kristin ' s week of doorstep work with ees . i ' m glad she
will still be in the building / houston however , because we are all working our
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress .
on that - just a couple of other things to mention .
1 . kim / leslie decided to keep ellen w - with a revised / upgraded role - which
is good for ellen . i think ellen ' s disappointment was that they told her she
was ' good to go ' on the tuesday - and changed their minds on wednesday -
invoking the ' 12 months ' rule . however - ellen seems over it - and is pleased
with her new role . point to note - it took an external ' inquiry ' to make them
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier
- just an observation .
2 . i ' m still a couple of good quality deal capture / documentation people
short . i would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest .
3 . enfiber - our valuation / risk management engine ( a cannabilised version of
enpower ) is up and running - and live .
hope you are well .

subject : re : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders
hi dave ,
of course the decision is politically motivated . but aren ' t they all ? it ' s just that now it ' s our ox being gored .
in general , review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential , i . e . , court ' s give agencies a lot of discretion - - - which is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision . but if a court concludes that the agency ' s action was "" arbitrary and capricious "" it may overturn the decision . our argument would be that ferc is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregarded - - - without explanation - - - its earlier rulings in this case . it ' s no slam dunk , but it ' s the best argument we have . we will never win an argument in any court that ferc "" could have "" or "" should have "" crafted its order a certain way ; a court will almost always say , "" the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit . "" however , courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due process .
as for the public ' s opinion of enron as a profiteer - - - for better or worse it ' s already established . and no matter what action we take , davis will cast a negative spin on it . so why not fight for our interests ? the stakes in this order are worth it . this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model ( power marketing ) ; it ' s hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs . the generators get to offset refunds with input costs , we should be able to use our purchased power costs . i don ' t see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word that ( 1 ) refunds can only be ordered within 60 days , and ( 2 ) all sellers are entitled to marginal costs . we are just holding the commission to its promise . at a minimum , the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings .
these are good questions . have a good weekend .
( i copied alan on this because i thought he might be interested in our colloquoy . )

steve ,
aside from the fact that the entire play by the ferc in the last 3 months has been purely politically motivated , are we going to challenge the latest rulings in court ? can we challenge this apparent lack of consistency ( memory loss ) ?
if we were to challenge do you think the general "" public "" opinion and impression of enron as a henious profiteer from houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challenge ?
just curious about what your thoughts / planned recommendation are .
thanks for the information ,

subject : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders
the ferc apparently has a very short memory :
1 . in its dec . 15 , 2000 order , ferc clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with ferc . how can ferc now say that transactions from nov . 1 through april 26 are subject to refund ? the dec . 15 order said that only transactions that were identified by commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability . otherwise , refund potential for transactions over $ 150 / mwh would close after 60 days . presumably , liability for transactions under $ 150 / mwh would close after 60 days , too .
here is the excerpt from the dec . 15 order :
"" we clarify that , unless the commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review , refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the commission . the institution of a 60 - day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff . "" dec . 15 order at 58 .
2 . in its nov . 1 order , ferc said that it would limit refund liability to seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . ferc now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs - - - much less opportunity costs - - - to offset potential refunds .
from the nov . 1 order : "" however , should we find it necessary to order refunds , we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . "" nov . 1 order at 39 .
ferc ' s july 25 order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding . arbitrary and capricious , anyone ?

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

vince and stinson ,
the valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months . the
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing . however , when comes to the
staff meeting ( thursday lunch meeting ) , we are often left out for updating
our projects .
this makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth
mentioning .
i am hoping that we can get more exposure , despite we are still in the old
economy .

i shipped you the paper along with my note to don . however , i wanted to
share with you what i feel are the remaining "" to dos "" . specifically ,
1 . we need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original
transformation of enron . specifically , the fallout from deregulation ( take
or pay contract defaults , etc . ) , the impact of the losses from the oil
trading operation , the nationalization of the peruvian pipeline , and the
leveraging up to fend off the carl ichan takeover attempt .
2 . we need to complete / beef up the network strategy section .
3 . finally , the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to
"" hammer home "" the basic principles underlying the transformation .
what do you think ?
hope you have a great weekend .

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be

analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &

split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,

11808,senate switch affects energy bill outlook,"at lpm houston time today , senator james jeffords ( r - vt ) will announce that he is switching from the republican party to become an independent voting with the democrats . if this happens , control of the senate will switch to the democrats , which will give the dems a majority and control of the senate .
? all committee chairs would become democratic and the dems would control the legislative agenda
( energy bills , california bailout , possible investigation of who influenced the cheney plan etc . ) . in a profound ideological shift , sen . murkowski ( r - ak ) would be replaced by sen . bingaman ( d - nm ) as chair of the senate energy committee . when bingaman takes over the senate energy committee , expect pipeline safety issues to again come to the fore . bingaman is a strong proponent of tough pipeline safety regulation ( particularly in the wake of the carlsbad explosion last year ) and will likely insist on strict safety requirements in the cheney energy bill .
? the recommendations for loosening regulations for oil / gas drilling , coal and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the cheney bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation - oriented measures .
? the tax bill will likely be downsized , particularly if jeffords makes his switch immediately . the timing is important because the senate - house conference on the bill must be appointed immediately .
? all presidential appointments would be controlled by the dems . this is significant because of the large number of sub - cabinet level appointments that need to be approved .
at the same time , republicans are trying to convince sen . zell miller ( d - ga ) , who already votes republican , to switch to the republican party . if this happens , it will cancel out the expected jeffords move . initial reports are that miller will not switch .
one other caveat - - jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then flaked out . but if jeffords goes through with it and miller stays put , the balance of power in washington will be tipped in favor of the democrats .",-1

vince will check with ena to see if they also want to attend . i would also

although margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other
key players as necessary . we should ask nesbitt how he would structure a
deal for multiple clients ( eg . ets , nbp , ena , and maybe el paso ) .
[ we need to remain aware of any "" affiliate "" issues that may result , and make
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs . ]
i will wait until after our meeting with nesbitt before deciding if / how to
approach el paso . presumably , if asked to particpate , they would share the
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed .

23431,re : clearing user meetings,"mary ,
thanks for your interest , i will add you .
the meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the
future . legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals . it was rumored at one
time that the web based receipt was sufficient for confirmation of the
deal .
this issue as well as many others will be discussed .
clearing users from london , calgary , and houston will have a chance to
present their requirements . these requirements will include
a need for web based clearing , the nature of which commodity logic is
developing . we are currently working closely with the commodity logic
project in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today
can be made as efficient as possible .
web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out
during these meetings , based on the requirements we will
work with london to develop a plan that get us where we need to be .
thanks for the invite , i will try and make it .

ron , please add me to the list for attendance . i have just a few questions ,
if you could answer them for me .
who is requesting / spearheading this meeting ? how does this meeting relate to
the requirements gathering already done / being done by commodity logic ?
isn ' t this a somewhat redundant effort , albeit a more organized approach ? in
other words , why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with
the commodity logic effort ? are you in competition or something ?
additionally , i should inform you that a company called confirmcorp offers a
service for confirm clearing . they are coming in tuesday afternoon to make a
presentation . it ' s probably a good idea if you attend . the meeting is in
49 c 4 . i will call you with additional information .

the purpose of these meetings is to flush out a consensus of what clearing
needs to be in the future .
we have invited interested parties from london , calgary and houston . folks
from clearing , legal , credit , commodity logic , and livelink have been
invited .
we are asking legal to clearly define the legal implications of web trading .
we expect web based clearing to be a hot topic ; commoditylogic can
represent a piece to the clearing puzzle .
attached is a tentative agenda . let me know if you have any ideas for making
this as productive as possible .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

fitch places marlin water trust ii & osprey trust i on rtg watch neg
fitch - ny - october 26 , 2001 : fitch has placed the ratings of
marlin water trust ii ' s ( marlin ii ' s ) approximately $ 915 million
senior secured notes due 2003 , and osprey trust ' s ( osprey ' s )
approximately $ 2 . 4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
rating watch negative . the marlin ii notes and the osprey notes
are currently rated ` bbb ' . this rating action follows the
placing of enron corp . ' s ratings on rating watch negative by
fitch .
the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund
account ( pre - funded interest ) and equity commitment from enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock . the
overfund account is invested in enron debt securities ( rated
' bbb + ' , rating watch negative ) , with payments used to service
interest to noteholders . payment of principal ultimately relies
on enron ' s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities . fitch currently rates enron ' s preferred
securities ' bbb - ' , rating watch negative . in addition , the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $ 125 million loan
to azurix europe limited , rated ` bbb + ' by fitch .
similarly , the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments . the mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust . the assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron
unsecured obligations ( the overfund account ) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock .
while various sources of repayment exist , such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering , in
each case primary credit support is derived from the enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120 - day prior to the maturity
date , which is one of the note trigger events . in the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes , enron is required to
deliver additional shares . if enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation , subject to certain standstill periods , then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
enron , representing a general unsecured claim . additional note
trigger events include a downgrade of enron ' s senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in enron ' s closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days , as well as customary
events of default under the notes . it is important to note that
enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt .
fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of enron , corp . and will update investors as
appropriate .
enron ' s debt falls as company draws down on bank loans

new york - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early friday following the houston energy giant ' s decision thursday to draw down about $ 3 billion on its bank loan facilities .
late thursday , enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community . specifically , the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $ 1 billion .
enron ' s 6 . 4 % bonds which come due in july 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar , down from around 82 cents on thursday .
trading activity in investment - grade bank debt like that of enron ' s isn ' t as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment - grade ratings . but fixed - income sources noted some offers friday for enron ' s bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar , still well - above distressed levels . they add that banks may want to try to sell enron ' s bank debt , which is now funded following the drawdown , but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago .
that was well before enron ran into its current market turmoil . last week , the company reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the company has said that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with andrew s . fastow , its former chief financial officer who was replaced on wednesday .
moody ' s investors service rates enron ' s senior unsecured debt at baal , though it ' s on review for a possible downgrade . fitch inc . and standard & poor ' s both rate the debt triple - b - plus . fitch also has enron ' s debt on review for a possible downgrade , while s joe . niedzielski @ dowjones . com

enron unit takes heat power group says energy firm failed bond requirements
jeffrey krasner , globe staff

( copyright 2001 )
the retail sales subsidiary of houston energy giant enron corp . faced expulsion last week from the new england group representing power generators , marketers and distributors . the sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills .
iso new england , which operates the power grid throughout the six new england states , urged nepool , the power industry group , to "" initiate termination proceedings "" for enron energy services inc . , according to a letter obtained by the globe .
an enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied nepool ' s requirements , and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights , including the failure of iso new england to warn enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels .
"" it was an administrative snafu , "" said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for enron . "" it ' s fixed . it ' s no big deal . we didn ' t get the paperwork in [ on time ] because it got sent to the wrong desk . it was taken care of on friday . ""
according to the letter , a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months . "" having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently , "" said ellen foley , an iso new england spokeswoman . in the letter , iso ' s chief financial officer , edward mckenna , said his organization "" has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications , and to date the financial assurance has not been cured . ""
but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous "" financial assurance "" defaults , which were corrected almost immediately . therefore , she said , the company was unaware that the current default was the third , which begins the expulsion proceeding . in addition , she said , the current default notice was sent to the wrong person , creating the delay that resulted in the letter . "" we ' re working with iso new england to figure that out , "" she said .
the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm ' s director of state government affairs , daniel w . allegretti , is the chairman of nepool ' s participant committee , which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization .
"" this is not that unusual within the pool , "" said allegretti . "" i frequently receive notices of technical defaults . "" as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation , he said , "" we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork . ""
the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron . the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm ' s chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions , the company said monday . enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo .
enron ' s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company ' s financial strength . the company reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow , according to the wall street journal . enron lost $ 618 million in the third quarter .
yesterday , enron ' s shares closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , on volume of 39 . 1 million shares .

enron has put up a page on its website of "" frequently asked questions "" in response to a barrage of analysts ' enquiries following last week ' s controversial results announcement .
unfortunately , the us energy group ' s critics have not been satisfied with the answers . nor has wednesday ' s decision to replace andrew fastow , its chief financial officer , quelled all investors ' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs .
however , analysts are pleased that kenneth lay , chief executive officer , is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "" partnerships "" . "" it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move , "" says ronald barone of ubs warburg . "" it ' s not the end of it . ""
the shares , which have tumbled since last week ' s results , ended a shade lower yesterday , off 0 . 37 per cent at dollars 16 . 35 . but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 - week high of dollars 84 . 87 until the group improves its transparency .
one of the frequently asked questions following enron ' s results announcement on october 16 concerned "" a dollars 1 . 2 bn ( pounds 840 m ) reduction in shareholders ' equity "" . the dollars 1 . 2 bn was not explained in the news release on the results , but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow - up conference call . many analysts confused it with a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge in the earnings report .
it has since been called a "" loss "" and a "" write - off "" and enron ' s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language .
enron ' s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders ' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm , a private equity fund formed by mr fastow , was an investor . when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles , enron "" recorded a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables . these adjustments were the result of enron ' s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods "" .
the confusion over the dollars 1 . 2 bn has further undermined the credibility of enron , which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .
analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group ' s debt ratio , which might hurt its debt rating .
mr lay held an analysts ' meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent . but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts . "" i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions , "" said goldman sachs ' david fleischer .
other analysts are also concerned about potential further write - offs . salomon smith barney ' s raymond niles points to enron ' s investments in its dabhol indian power plant , its south american investments , and its remaining telecoms assets . most importantly , he says , they may include several of enron ' s other off - balance - sheet vehicles .
"" frankly , we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them , "" mr niles says . other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival . el paso said it was facing "" a lot of questions on its accounting practices "" .

enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 )

enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 )
( adds egan - jones lowering credit rating in 12 th paragraph . )
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn ' t be lowered and tapped a $ 3 billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets .
enron ' s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after
investors questioned the company ' s transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer . the stock
fell 45 cents to $ 15 . 90 in early afternoon trading today .
` ` people are questioning the credibility of management , ' '
said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion of fixed income
assets at fifth third bancorp . ` ` it looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself . ' '
enron is shut out of commercial paper markets , where short -
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer . the company will
use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said .
the company ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds which mature in 2009
declined 1 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an
offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating
of ` ` bbb + , ' ' yield 9 . 53 percent .
enron ' s shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in
third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions .
dilution concerns
though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies
with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for
seven years .
a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value
of enron investors ' stock .
partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron
assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books . the
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets .
if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money
comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt .
one way would be issuing common shares in exchange for enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would
thin out the holding of every other investor .
of the two main bond rating companies , moody ' s investors
service has the company on watch for possible downgrade , and
standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to
negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on
enron ' s debt to bb + , one notch below investment grade , from bbb - .
other liabilities
enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said .
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct
losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was
named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , chairman and
chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement .

i spoke with my students yesterday and they told me they have thought
about coming to see you again , and they think it ' ll be much better in
the future when they are closer to completion of their ph . d . i think this
is a very sound idea , but i wanted to give them anyway the opportunity
to see the actual working environment at a place like enron . they are both
very serious and responsible , so they feel they had better go see you when
they would be in a better disposition to give more of themselves to enron .
they are both superb students and very hard working individuals , so i do
hope you will consider checking them out in the future ( within a year -
year and a half ) .
i will contact you and / or stinson in the future when they are closer
to finishing up .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

11271,california 3 / 23,"executive summary :
bottom line - qfs better off today , utilities in worse shape
after passing senate , the qf bill fails on technical grounds in assembly
cal energy ruling provides possible escape for qfs from utility commitments
california net short gas supply for the summer worsens if qfs break contracts
hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper , further litigation expected
1 . qf bill fails in surprise twist
ab 8 x ( the qf bill ) failed in the assembly ( 48 - 24 ) . the republicans were opposed because three measures , the sdg & e fix , the ab lx fix , and the qf fix were all rolled into one bill by the senate . they want the three measures split up . concern was raised by san diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in sb 43 x . as noted yesterday , the qfs will now await a cpuc ruling on tuesday .
2 . cal energy ruling sets stage for "" dozens "" of similar q . f . suits
the cpuc ruling is now less important because of the cal energy ruling yesterday , which gave the qfs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities . cal energy reportedly would have filed an involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow ( friday ) had they not won their law suit . dozens , if not hundreds of suits identical to that filed by calenergy can now be expected from the other qfs . the qfs reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct into the merchant market , possibly out - of - state . they also want to avoid any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a stage 2 or stage 3 alert , and will contest any such measure with the ferc .
3 . summer outlook worsens
the outlook for the summer now appears much grimmer for the state . if the gas - fired qfs alone manage to extricate themselves from their contracts with the utilities , the state will be a net 10 , 000 mw short for the summer rather than 5 , 000 mw . this is a much larger net short position to fill , and will be much harder for state treasurer angelides to sell to wall street . if all of the qfs break their contracts , the state will be 14 , 000 to 15 , 000 mw short . essentially , if the qfs are successful in court ( as it appears they would be ) , they are no longer part of the pool of low , fixed - rate power that the state can count on . the onus now appears to be on treasurer angelides to come up with a rate schedule . the qfs may go to him and ask for the state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts ( the state would , of course , charge for this privilege ) and negotiate a more flexible rate structure .
4 pressure mounts on utilities
none of this helps the utilities ' situation . in fact , now that the qfs have a way out of their contracts through the courts , it appears that the business base of the utilities is reduced , so they are actually in a worse situation . reportedly some of the utilities ' commercial paper now has been sold to hedge funds . as one source put it , "" the vultures have moved in . "" these are "" the types of people who litigate . """,-1

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

vince ,
thanks for your response . apparently , we were under the incorrect impression
that your group would be taking li ( based on jeff ' s note below ) . we
apologize for not contacting you last friday to confirm prior to "" placing "" li
in your group . i have faxed li ' s resume to you and hope that you will have
time to review it today . please call me back as soon as you can to discuss
li ' s opportunities in your group .
if vince is not interested in li for his group , we will consider li placed in
ena - gas trading ( original placement ) in john lavorato ' s organization . once
i hear from vince one way or the other , the program will consider li ' s
placement final in either research or ena - gas trading . hopefully this will
be resolved by tuesday morning so that we may communicate to li her rotation
information . if you have any questions , please let me know .
thank you !

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",-1

subject : re : joint probabilities
the attached spreadsheet has been updated to include probabilities for
exceeding stated stock prices in each year .
these numbers represent the probability for all combinations of rab ratio and
exchange rate . for example , 2003 shows a stock value of 7 . 38 for a rab = 1 . 1
and fx = 1 . 5 . we previously showed the prob of exceeding a stock price of
7 . 38 , and rab > 1 . 1 , fx > 1 . 5 as 14 % . the probability of exceeding 7 . 38 for
all possible values of rab and fx is 35 % ( interpolating between 40 % and 27 %
in the price table ) .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

0 . 6 % ; califor nia contracts get some attention ; major earnings week ahead
>
good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
summary :
1 . ipps rise 0 . 6 % last week our ipp composite rose 0 . 6 % , outperforming
both the s & p 500 ( - 1 . 7 % ) and the nasdaq ( - 1 . 9 % ) . mirant , which was up 5 . 2 % ,
was the strongest generator in the group . international power was the
weakest performer , declining 5 . 8 % .
2 . generation oriented utilities fall 0 . 8 % our universe of generation
oriented utilities declined 0 . 8 % , outperforming both the s & p 500 and nasdaq ,
while underperforming the uty ( + 0 . 6 % ) . constellation energy , which was up
3 . 3 % , was the strongest performer in the group . black hills was the weakest
performer , declining 5 . 6 % .
3 . california contracts dominate investor attention last week there was
some renewed concern among investors that the state of california would
attempt to renegotiate its 53 power sales contracts with various power
generators and marketers . over the long - term we see minimal risk for the
generators . we believe california has few legal options with respect to
these agreements . further , the signing of these contracts played a key role
in reigning in spot power prices in the state . finally , governor davis
apparently does not support a massive contract renegotiation effort .
4 . some headline risk remains the only issue we see involves headline
risk . while the governor and his administration appear to be taking a
restrained approach with regard to the contracts , political pressure to
renegotiate continues to grow from the cpuc and the state attorney general ' s
office . while we ultimately expect such efforts to be unsuccessful , in the
near term this issue will continue to attract media attention .
5 . earnings season upon us this week the bulk of the ipp ' s and generation
oriented utilities are scheduled to report earnings . in the ipp group ,
results are expected from : aes , cpn and rri . in the generation oriented
utility group , results are expected from : cnl , dpl , etr , fpl , ppl and xel .
we expect capital discipline to be a recurring theme emphasized by companies
on their upcoming conference calls . in response to stock prices which are
trading below private market asset values , we expect management teams across
the sector to de - emphasize growth and begin using stricter hurdle rates when
evaluating new investment opportunities .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

great . keep in mind - some people continue to confuse "" wellhead portfolio ""
with "" deals done by producer services . "" all that should be in the wellhead
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by greg sharp ' s

i worked with tom acton last night to get the wellhead portfolio cleaned up .
tom had a sheet from vance that we used to determine what deals should be in

review of energy policies kicks off
asahi shimbun
april 25 , 2000
a government advisory panel on monday embarked on a
comprehensive review of energy - related policies .
` ` we want to come up with feasible policies and at the
same time clearly present reasons for those policies , ' '
yoichi kaya , a professor emeritus at the university of
tokyo , told a meeting of the coordination subcommittee
under the advisory committee for energy , an advisory
panel to minister of international trade and industry
takashi fukaya . kaya chairs the subcommittee .
the nuclear development policy , including the
government ' s goal for building new nuclear power plants ,
is expected to be a focus of the discussions .
a spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of
plants increasingly difficult , and the nation ' s power
suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power
plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20
to 13 .
the subcommittee , set up for the first time in about 10
years , is made up of about 30 members , and members of
anti - nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been
included for the first time .
some members told monday ' s meeting that the
government must stop taking the nuclear development
policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility
of introducing renewable energy , such as wind and solar
power .
also on the agenda will be energy saving measures .
energy consumption in the residential and commercial
sector , made up of homes and offices , and in the
transportation sector , which includes cars and trucks , has
almost doubled over the past 25 years .
at monday ' s meeting , many members stressed the need
to change public consciousness toward the use of
energy .
miti plans to present studies on how life would be
affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as
automatically turning off air conditioners at certain
temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle .",-1

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus
in the
gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing
sense
that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and
steep
decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into
the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the
mid -
$ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual
fuel oil
in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage
inventories
will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera  , s view adequate
supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a
quick
return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap .
storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october
20
accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift
in
market psychology . last week  , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately
3 . 8
bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58
bcf
above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october
22 .
with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures
expected
next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on
october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table
1 ) .
is this inventory level "" enough "" ? not yet . storage inventories this winter
under 15 -
year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf
above
the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total
withdrawals in
the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above
last year  , s
withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face
of a
return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would
bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and
growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this
winter ,
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following :
* industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol
producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down . these markets represent
approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return ,
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol .
* the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning
residual fuel oil must remain off of gas .
in cera  , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis ,
particularly
as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter
demand can
be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can
be held
reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march
1996
and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average
of
$ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was
nearly
4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was
lower ,
and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas
customers in
the united states .
market fundamentals in cera  , s view still support gas prices above those of
resid ,
which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm
weather throughout november and into december could reverse this
relationship , but
a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few
weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the
market .
cera  , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - -
stands for now .

sec seeks information on enron dealings with partnerships recently run by fastow

enron corp . said it has been contacted by the securities and exchange commission seeking information on the energy giant ' s controversial dealings with partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow .
following enron ' s announcement yesterday morning of the sec inquiry , the company ' s stock took another big slide , falling more than 20 % in new york stock exchange trading . as of 4 p . m . , enron shares were trading at $ 20 . 65 , off $ 5 . 40 , knocking about $ 4 billion off enron ' s market capitalization . volume topped the big board ' s most - active list at about 36 million shares . a week ago , enron stock was trading at about $ 33 a share . subsequently , the company announced a $ 1 . 01 billion third - quarter write - off that produced a $ 618 million loss .
analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurking amid enron ' s vast and extremely complex operations . the company has dealings with a number of related entities . under certain circumstances , if enron ' s credit rating and stock price fall far enough , the company would be obligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities , diluting the holdings of current shareholders .
enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is strong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults .
in a statement , enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said the company "" will cooperate fully "" with the sec inquiry and "" look ( s ) forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . "" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions .
the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment .
certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors .
since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships .
mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post .
mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests .
investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur .
for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s .
currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade .

where did the value go at enron ?
by floyd norris
new york times
what really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ?
wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quote
senior columnist
thestreet . com
10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edt
url :
enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market .
the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance .
enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction .
enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text .
instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called "" structured finance arrangement . "" the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow .
this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : "" in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . "" according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares .
enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future .
but there are two possible problems with this theory .
first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance .
second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down .
why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : "" at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . "" the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices .
but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been "" in the money "" , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 .
maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where .
presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .",-1

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

i have given to your admin a copy of the cogentrix ca and have bracketed the language that needs your approval . legal had originally told me that i needed detmering and donahue to sign off . detmering has told me that either you or lavorato need to sign off . per my conversation with donahue , he is o . k . because kristina mordaunt has signed off on the language .
we have a little over a week to get a preliminary , non - binding bid in , if the original schedule holds , and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines , but we are now starting to be backed against the wall . this language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation .

new facsimile machine information
please take a look @ the following and let me know , which fax machine you
choose or if you need information on something smaller , then i will have the
vendor contact you directly to finalise installation . an enron director or
above { with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract } will
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
installed . delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
either vendor listed below will be able to provide a "" loaner "" should you have
a business need . please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
when ordering the equipment .
if there is no existing fax line present , you will need to send a notes - mail
to the move team { erica @ x 3 - 3185 or janelle @ x 5 - 7917 } requesting the
installation of a new fax line . the move team can be found in the notes - mail
"" ect address book "" .
if you are an ees employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ees budget control . contact susan mcleroy @ x 5 - 8066 or via notes - mail .
if you are an ebs employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ebs purchasing & budget control . contact paula corey @ x 3 - 9948 or martha
reyna @ x 3 - 3491 . you can reach both of these people via notes - mail .
if you are an ena employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ena finance & budget control . contact lorie belsha @ x 3 - 9617 or via
notes - mail .
a note on the fax machines listed below :
all the machines listed below come with a 2 nd paper tray and upgraded memory
{ maxed by model ~ see below } as an enron standard from each vendor .
all the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33 . 6 kbps versus
the canon laserclass 7500 { example only } @ 14 . 4 kbps = new fax machine should
be noticeably quicker .
document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the
canon laserclass 7500 { example only }
maintenance = models listed below have maintenance / repair coverage included
in monthly $ total . there is no separate agreement ! toner / drum cartridges +
paper + line charges are extra { not quoted }
contract pricing can change without warning , so please let me know asap if a
vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
models .
if the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment , here are some
considerations :
no more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look @ the fax machine
placement on eb 30 or eb 31 .
disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33 . 6 k modem and jbig
compression { or equivalent } .
look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost . { models
quoted are loaded } .
maintenance is to be included in monthly cost { models quoted are covered } .

executive summary
? senate may seal socal ' s fate
? socal edison eyeing bankruptcy
california senate an additional two dissenting democrat votes would effectively block ab 67 xx . consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill ( because it lacks the state ' s ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates ) are "" optimistic "" about the bill ' s defeat in the senate . despite these circumstances , it is highly conceivable that the senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the assembly ' s approval .
burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with davis over ab 67 xx and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline , burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the senate . if the bill passes , the assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is , or reject the bill and risk socal ' s bankruptcy . we believe that if the bill makes it into the assembly , ab 67 xx will pass despite strong opposition from both the ctma and consumer advocates . there is no current vote count available in the assembly , but we expect the assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of saturday morning .
inside edison
there are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed , socal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor , most likely a generator , will take them into bankruptcy . socal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash ( by the dwr , etc . ) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows . from the generators ' perspective , if a plan is passed , the bank creditors will get paid but they will not . also , the dwr and iso have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year , let alone when they will be paid . the total amount owed through the iso is approximately $ 2 b . nonetheless , the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state . once a deal is passed leaving too little money for socal to pay the generators , this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against socal .
socal has privately indicated to senators that if the ab 67 xx fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component , socal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds . socal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high . the ctma also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power .
socal has not communicated a position on whether the $ 400 million trim ( from the original $ 2 . 9 b ) puts them into bankruptcy . we estimate that an additional $ 400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition .",-1

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

16750,"duke plant employees turn out to be disgruntled , misinformed","employees with an ax to grind
these guys filed a bunch of complaints against sempra too , back when sempra owned the plant . - - - sch
duke ' s calif whistleblowers have history of grievances updated : wednesday , june 27 , 2001 07 : 36 pm et
by jason leopold
of dow jones newswires
los angeles ( dow jones ) - - three former employees who last week told california lawmakers duke energy ( duk , news , msgs ) ramped down its south bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant , including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination , the men told dow jones newswires .
most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant ' s previous owner , sempra energy ( sre , news , msgs ) unit san diego gas & electric , for which the men continued to work while duke controlled the plant . but interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with duke ' s profit - centered management style in the deregulated market .
duke has called the employees ' allegations about its operating procedures "" baseless . "" duke has said the employees have an "" ax to grind , "" because they weren ' t hired by the company in april when escrow on the power plant closed and duke acquired some of sdg & e ' s workforce .
the men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers , who are locked in a high - stakes struggle with the state of california over allegations of price gouging . the state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives .
glenn johnson , 52 , a mechanic at the south bay power plant , alone filed 30 complaints . on one occasion , johnson said he called the california division of occupational safety and health , because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos . he also has a harassment complaint against sdg & e regarding an employee who now works for duke , but johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it .
aside from the formal complaints , johnson said under the duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment .
"" this is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business , "" he said .
one of the other employees , jim olkjer , 56 , a former assistant control room operator at the power plant , filed three complaints against sdg & e while duke operated the plant , because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision . the grievances were either turned down or settled , he said .
olkjer said he decided to testify against duke after he learned he wouldn ' t be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in april .
"" i ' m on a fixed income now , "" olkjer said in an interview . "" i can ' t afford my utility bills on a fixed income . ""
the third employee , ed edwards , 42 , a certified power plant mechanic , said he filed one complaint against three sdg & e employees in 1999 for racial discrimination . one of the employees was hired by duke . that case is still pending .
edwards , an african - american , said duke didn ' t hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less - qualified white employees . edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under sdg & e were replaced with white employees when duke took over .
edwards , who stopped working at the plant in february , said he decided to testify against duke after receiving a phone call from johnson .
"" i knew i wouldn ' t be hired , "" he said .
edwards and johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against sdg & e with the u . s . equal employment opportunity commission .
sdg & e spokesman art larson wouldn ' t comment on the allegations . duke spokesman tom williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and "" always hires the most qualified employees . ""
in 1999 , duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the u . s . department of labor for $ 769 , 700 , in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions .
dissatisfaction with new priorities
the former employees said they weren ' t motivated to blow the whistle on duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state . johnson first alerted the media about duke ' s behavior before state attorney general bill lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers .
the employees each earned about $ 1 , 000 a week .
all three employees said they believe duke mismanaged the south bay power plant by ramping the units up and down , tossing out spare parts , and operating machinery when it was broken . olkjer said he saw the plant ' s output reduced during the worst power emergencies "" at least 50 times . ""
when edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him , "" it ' s none of your business . ""
the employees said that duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff , and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant .
"" i was paid to twist wrenches , "" johnson said . "" the last raise i got two years ago was 2 . 25 % . that ' s an insult to my skill . ""
duke said it is bringing the former sdg & e employees under its contract with international brotherhood of electrical workers local 1245 . the workers were previously represented by another local , and duke wanted a single contract .
johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on duke because he was disgusted by the company ' s "" gluttony and greed . "" he said he stole the control room logs in february after a colleague pointed out to him that duke was reducing output at the plant .
johnson , edwards and olkjer said "" in the old days "" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down . but as soon as deregulation became law in the state , things started to change . sdg 323 - 658 - 3874 ; jason . leopold @ dowjones . com

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

will it be good ? i know it is not that much earlier than i mentioned . . 6 / 4
i am sorry .
and actually , there is an e - business conference at haas school of business ,
organized by my advisor
could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e - business and especially procurement ?
the link is as following .
i am afraid you might forgot this i told you in the last email . . .
my advisor ( arie segev at haas school of business ; segev @ haas . berkeley . edu )
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer , while i am staying there .
his interest is in e - business . . ( what else . . ? )
and has expertise in e - procurement system and marketplace . . .
xml based standard such as obi , cxml , xcbl , rosettanet , biztalk . .
system interoperability study , auction and negotiation , workflow system ,
e - catalog management , digital signature , edi , etc etc . . .
many technical aspects of e - business . . .
he wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both enron and him .
he may travel one or two times to houston to have a meeting during the
summer .
( and to be frankly , this will be good for me too ,
because i can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in houston . . )
could you think about the possibility of joint research , with him ?

1002,accrued 06 / 16,here is a breakdown by day of all of the counterparties .,-1
22844,doorpost - post doorstep,"in my response to brent price on the london doorstep review i alluded to the
incompleteness of the list of issues . as i outlined , the key point has been
identified , but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying ,
especially as they concern the continental power operation :
as of today the most recent finalised dpr for this business was for 11 th may ,
and during the period between then and now we have seen ( although in milder
form ) a repeat of the turmoil on the amsterdam power exchange ( apx ) that we
witnessed in january this year . this is not the time or the market to not
know our position .
the business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new
transaction on the polish border . i am bound to comment that based on the
state it appears to be in , i would not recommend higher limits .
to add insult to injury , as a result of the way this area has been allowed to
develop , much of the know - how is in the heads ( and spreadsheets ) of certain
key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for ebs .
uk gas seems to have slipped too . yesterday they reported a $ 7 m loss due to
the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal , booked
"" off - system "" and not revalued for over a month . worryingly , there seemed to
be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a loss notification memo , than
answering some fundamental questions about why it happened .
as a corollary , our process of performing "" risk reviews "" has become all the
more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market
risk in the firm . i expect these to play a big part in our effort to
stabilise these areas .

subject : re : project doorstep responsibility matrix
thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments
arrive too late . here they are anyway :
1 socrates
i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have
primary responsibility for this system / project .
but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this
project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in
history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart .
2 exhaustive ?
it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such .
3 symptoms or causes ?
many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will
likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is
applied .
in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 :
"" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality . . . ""
because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation
errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think
about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move
on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they
did .
i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on
microsoft excel all day , everyday .
4 overall
i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking
off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate .
as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality ?

25235,transfers from ees,"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .

please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .

13163,new calpine twist,"it ' s getting strange . . .
calpine wants to see our offer :
big prepay - $ 200 mm - $ 300 mm
epmi sells 200 mw + 7 x 24
dp : np - 15 or sp - 15
price : $ 61
start : 7 / 02
term : 5 - 10 years
rationale : they have $ 61 dwr contracts . at this point the dwr contracts are tied to their accrual generation business . if we pay them for the right to sell $ 61 ' s , they can get the cash and recognize the earnings .
like the rest of this story , selling to a generator sounds strange . however , if the forward market is trading below their stated price forecast , they may want to buy , not sell .
perhaps we go down a parallel path : bids in the east , offers in the west .
maybe we end up in a seller - financing deal : loan $ for investment in new power and purchase of sites , equipment , erc ' s .
dave and i are available to compare notes and discuss strategy .
regards ,
chris calger

subject : dip financing and other cash flows
attached is the spreadsheet we talked about on the phone . the numbers in the sheet represent what was shown to the dip lenders last
weekend in order to obtain financing . in many cases all revenues and other items were completely eliminated leaving only operating expense and
capital expenditures . we were trying to be as conservative as possible but also show a viable entity going forward . i hope we were not to far off .
what we would like you to do is populate this format with the numbers you believe to be true going forward based on the recent changes . we also need a detailed
explanation of what is in the numbers . a few things to remember are :
this estimate should contain no allocations except for what you believe you salaries and wages would be post reduction ( normally paid by corp )
operating expenses includes salaries , outside services , benefits , employee expenses and any other items normally in operating expenses including
non employee expenses and taxes other than income taxes . please provide as much detail as possible . there is space for detailed opex at the bottom of the page . call me if you have questions .
although in chapter 11 interest and income taxes are not paid , please provide these to the extent your business unit pays them . we will adjust for
entities that are in the filing .
i understand there is a big global effort to identify assets for sale but please provide your best estimate to date along with the detail and we will compare to the global effort .
capex and investing should be mandatory only . please provide detail back up .
to the extent your business has any financing activities please provide . again we will adjust for filing entities .
we need this as soon as possible but no later than friday morning 9 : 00 am .
this should be a realistic view of your business unit as run under chapter 11 . we are only focused on cash items now . please provide backup detail for any
item you think needs it or is not self evident . please do not hesitate to call myself 57852 or greg adams 33887 with questions .
shortly this format will be expanded to weekly for dec ' 01 and 13 weeks of 2002 with monthly through the remainder of 2002 . this is the attachment
that was suppose to be attached to the email from rick causey . below is a list of the cao ' s / leads and what entities they are responsible for .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

bush administration extends emergency supply orders
despite recent indications that the bush administration would take a more
hands - off approach to the california crisis , energy secretary spencer abraham
late yesterday gave pg & e and southern california edison another two weeks of
breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power
suppliers to continue supplying the cash - strapped utilities . the emergency
gas order now expires at 3 a . m . ( est ) feb . 7 .
in granting the extensions , abraham urged the state to get to work to solve
its own problems . he said only california can implement the policies
necessary to resolve the short - term and long - term supply challenges . "" our
action today is designed to give the governor , the california legislature and
other relevant parties the time to take necessary action . i strongly urge the
parties to act immediately , "" said abraham . he also said he was keenly aware
that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply
situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas .
despite the action , pg & e said it still is having trouble getting gas
suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued jan . 19 . "" the
gas supply situation is [ not good ] , "" utility spokeswoman staci homrig said
yesterday afternoon . "" we are quickly depleting our storage . even under the
order , j . aron & co . [ a subsidiary of goldman sachs ] has not delivered gas .
they represent about 9 % of our daily needs ( 1 . 5 bcf / d in january ) .
"" oh yeah , we ' ve been in contact with them , "" she said . "" we ' ve been in contact
with the doe , too . the other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to
us last week have made gas available to us under the order . they are sempra
energy trading and western gas resources . "" homrig said pg & e expected doe to
take legal action against those who didn ' t resume deliveries . the order
applied to 27 gas suppliers , all of which supplied gas to pg & e within the
last 30 days .
"" there ' s not a lot i can say , "" said j . aron spokeswoman kate baum . "" j . aron
has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order .
that ' s my statement . i can neither confirm nor deny anything else . ""
meanwhile , other suppliers who were not among those on the doe ' s list , were
staying as far away from california as possible . "" all i know is we ' re not
selling in california any more . a person could get fired around here for
doing that , "" said one marketer . "" all we had in california were a few spot
deals that expired at the end of december . needless to say we didn ' t re - up
them . ""
without the doe ' s order , pg & e would be back where it was last week , with some
suppliers stopping delivery , others planning to stop at the end of their
contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the
utility .
pg & e has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply
under such a scenario until the first week in february . homrig said pg & e ' s
storage currently is well below 50 % full , or less than 16 bcf and depleting
rapidly by about 500 mmcf / d to 1 bcf / d . pg supplies remain tight
depending on your perspective , california either moved toward future
solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward
yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for
long - term , fixed - price supplies .
the auction began yesterday and will run through noon today . the state is
seeking sealed bids for six - month , three - year , five - year and 10 - year supply
agreements . whether results of the auction would be made public was still
unclear yesterday , but the results are expected to be given to legislators ,
who now are debating various long - term solutions in the state senate .
a spokesperson in the state assembly speaker ' s office said the legislature is
basically "" standing by , "" awaiting more price information . action on the
proposed comprehensive legislation , including the question of the state
taking over the private utilities ' hydroelectric systems , should come by the
end of the week .
merrill lynch said yesterday it was "" increasingly skeptical "" that the
"" securitization for hydro "" plan would go forward . it has received "" muted
support , "" merrill lynch said , and has not been drafted as a bill yet . recent
revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract
flexibility , with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of
energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of $ 55 / mwh ,
which is well below the utilities retail rate caps ( edison at $ 72 . 40 / mwh and
pg & e at $ 66 ) . the difference is expected to be used to pay down the
utilities ' debt .
meanwhile , the electric system limped along under the specter of another
stage three yesterday , but without rolling blackouts , and elsewhere
indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written
off california from their prospective marketing lists .
"" we ' re not selling in california any more , a person could get fired for doing
that around here , "" said one texas - based gas marketer , referring to the
continuing credit problems of pacific gas and electric co . , which has been
hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas
side , too .
in the meantime , southern california edison co . is back in federal district
court in los angeles , where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks
ago . this time it is asking for the court to force the california public
utilities commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale
cost of power .
calling the action with the court "" a last resort , "" edison said it has tried
to get the rate situation resolved , but at every turn it has met "" resistance ,
denial and finger - pointing "" by the cpuc ' s five - member governor - appointed
board .
the cpuc on tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the
hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled
this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the
environmental review of the ongoing case looking at pg & e ' s hydro utility
assets . "" the current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the
commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony , "" the cpuc said
in a prepared statement .",-1

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

good to hear from you . things are going pretty well hear , but busy with the
end of the semester coming up .
as for u of h , i guess there are several possibilities depending on what
shane wants to do . the best researcher in their group by far , in my
opinion , is bong - soo lee . but he does more general asset pricing stuff .
minnesota econ phd , really smart . their main derivatives guy is rabon
rabinovich . he ' s done some good work in the past but not very active in the
last five or ten years . or , you could go with ron singer or art warga
( art ' s more respected and more active ) . these guys are more senior , more
general , and do more research than ramon - - i would guess that they tend to
be the workhorses in terms of advising phd students at u of h .
in any case , please destroy this info as soon as you digest it . i would
hate for my candidate assessments to ever get passed along to the good folks
at u of h .

29165,davis appoints cpuc commissioner,"gov . davis announced today his appointment of mike peevey as commissioner at the cpuc to replace com . bilas who resigned last week . mr . peevey is the former president of southern california edison and as such advocated deregulation . consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state senate approval . below is an article from the sacramento bee . gh
davis names ex - edison chief to puc
but the action stirs anger : ' our worst nightmare , ' says a consumer lawyer .
by stuart leavenworth - - bee staff writer
published 5 : 30 a . m . pst wednesday , march 6 , 2002
gov . gray davis has appointed a former president of southern california edison to a state panel charged with regulating edison and other public utilities .
davis said michael r . peevey would bring "" more than three decades of experience "" to the public utilities commission - - experience that immediately came under fire from the state ' s consumer groups .
mike florio , a lawyer for the utility reform network , said peevey has a record , both in government and in business , of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers .
"" this is a our worst nightmare , "" florio said . "" it is like putting dr . kevorkian in charge of a nursing home . ""
others were more supportive . d . j . smith , a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users , lauded peevey as someone "" who understands all sides of the energy business "" and will be fair to all sides .
"" i think he will be objective about edison because he doesn ' t owe edison anything , "" said smith , noting that peevey left the southern california utility nine years ago .
the husband of assemblywoman carol liu , d - south pasadena , peevey replaces puc commissioner richard bilas , who resigned last week . bilas was appointed by gov . pete wilson .
if confirmed by the state senate , peevey will solidify davis ' control over the puc , a five - member board that now includes three of the governor ' s appointees . it also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state ' s other large utility , pacific gas and electric co . , on terms for pg & e ' s reorganization in federal bankruptcy court .
pg & e spokesman ron low declined to comment on the appointment tuesday , but last year peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped pg & e avoid bankruptcy .
hired by davis to negotiate with the utility , peevey reportedly struck a deal with pg & e chairman bob glynn that would have let pg & e charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity . but other davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart .
for three years , peevey was president of edison international and southern california edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company chairman john bryson .
peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of newenergy inc . , an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to aes corp . after working as an adviser to davis , he had been ceo of truepricing inc . and also has served on the board of excelergy corp . , an energy software company .
with his new six - year puc job , peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants , water companies , natural gas supplies and other industries .
after a review by puc lawyers , peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict , davis spokesman steve maviglio said .
peevy ' s appointment was one of two davis made tuesday . he also appointed john l . geesman to the board of the independent system operator , which manages most of the state power grid .
since 1985 , geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for rbc dain rauscher inc . in san francisco . he once served on turn ' s board .
consumer groups , which had pressed for a meeting with davis for the past week , said the he may have timed his election day appointment of peevey to minimize negative media coverage .
maviglio called that claim "" ludicrous . "" today ' s papers , he said , "" will be some of the best read this year . """,-1

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be

coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

all shippers letter # 02 - 033
date : 3 / 15 / 02
time : 11 : 00 a . m . mst
subject : system operations
the purpose of this letter is to inform northwest ' s shippers of how it
intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by questar pipeline
at clay basin and by transwestern pipeline at its la plata facilities .
questar pipeline has announced it will shut in its clay basin facility from
april 2 , 2002 through april 15 , 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests
on april 16 and 17 , 2002 . during this time northwest will have no access to
clay basin . additionally , transwestern pipeline has announced that its la
plata compressor facilities will be shut in from april 2 through april 5 ,
2002 , and will accept no deliveries from northwest pipeline .
during the month of march north flow volumes through the kemmerer compressor
have exceeded capacity on a regular basis . with clay basin shut in ,
northwest ' s balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired . northwest
will have no place to inject excess gas south of kemmerer and as a result
cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes .
if north flow volumes continue to exceed kemmerer capacity during the
questar and transwestern maintenance , northwest will take the following
steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system : reduce line
pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance ; cut
north - flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata
to meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling
through kemmerer ; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries
from receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate
confirmed nominations ; entitle for undertakes or overtakes , as appropriate ;
and finally , if required , northwest will issue operational flow orders .
if net scheduled volumes north through northwest ' s kemmerer compressor do
not exceed physical capacity , northwest will have much greater flexibility
during the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins . northwest ' s customers can
help themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by
securing adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson
prairie storage during this work .
northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of
the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins and will be monitoring the
situation closely . northwest will take every opportunity to relax system
restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate . northwest is
confident that if its customers respond prudently , the impact of the
transwestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced .
if you have any questions , please contact your marketing services
representative .",-1

after speaking with richard burchfield and brian hudson , i thought that it
would be appropriate to update both of you and beth as to it ' s commitment .
richard asked that he send out the message and i agreed . one reason for
doing this was to show that the operations and it groups are working together
towards a common goal . the other reason was to ensure that i had it ' s buy - in
to completing this database in a timely fashion .
our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in ql
2001 . the actual roll out will happen in phases prior to january so that we
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture ,
valuation , and the necessary reporting and accounting tools . by using brian
hudson ' s it team i can be assured that the global needs are met .
i will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further ,

todd ,
per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a weather
trading and valuation engine . i have discussed the high level requirements
with joseph koothrappaly and have identified an it lead to manage the
project . as discussed , the project will have the same project formula as the
"" thunderball "" project with 3 - 6 month deliverables . also , the need to have
co - operative development between houston and london will be established for
global roll out of the weather system . the main focus will be a intranet
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine . the plan calls
for phase i roll out for january 1 , 2001 . next steps will need to be
discuss as soon as possible . topics that need to be addressed are definition
of phase i , joint development between houston and london , and duel
development between steve stock ' s valuation team and my trading team . keep in
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments , one person
will manage the effort across teams .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .

3508,proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all,"affiliates
ngi ' s daily gas price index
breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm
proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates
federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .
previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .
the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .
commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . "" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . ""
wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded .
wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

see below . lets see how many we can get louise by 12 - 1 pm
presto ' s needs to chnage to 1 / 3 1 / 3 1 / 3 grants rather than all next week , so hold his back .
louise , michelle and i just spoke and she is checking the drafts that were prepared this weekend and making some changes . you will have them in batches during course of the afternoon . obviously these are drafts and will need to be redone before anyone can sign ( and potentially changed to modify strike date language in case they elect that option ) . in addition , i thought we were only focusing on the first 15 names on john ' s spreadsheet at least for this 2 day exercise ? your list below includes a number further down . i thought we agreed we could hold off on them until next week ? i don ' t think we will be able to get all the 46 done over next 2 days and would recommend we focus initially on top 15 or so .
kari / sheila , please be on point to ferry these forms back and forth today and tomorrow . we need someone to focus purely on this for the next 48 hours .

6597,re : mec,"mark ,
steve ' s comment has many merits . i think stinson gibner and grant masson
( physics ph . d . ' s ) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims .
on the other hand , even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in
their time estimates , the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous
potential payoffs . it make sense to
stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities .

subject : re : mec
i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2 - 3
years from commercial production . ideally , we could get that confirmation
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest
in its success . their technology pitch sounded good , but i don ' t know enough
to recognize the potential shortcomings . i want to feel comfortable that you
all feel this is real , then i would be happy to have me and my team spend
some time with them .

thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .

11443,re : turbines from esa,"louise :
sorry for the delay in getting back to you . i ' m on vacation this week , and did not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon .
brett and i have been working through our respective groups on finalizing numbers for the ft . pierce turbine . i expect that we should have numbers tomorrow . the only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating change orders and spare parts between the two mhi turbines which are presently under one contract . by tomorrow , we expect to have a proposed cost allocation and will then present it to brett for his review and approval .
with respect to the second mhi unit , dave duran , ozzie pagan and i have a call scheduled tomorrow to discuss the homestead project . on the development side , we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid - may . we are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two mhi 501 fs . at least to this point , our proposed site has not raised the type of controversy we have experienced in broward county .
lastly , i wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local approvals for our midway site in st . lucie county . greg krause ( a director in my group ) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this . this project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in florida .
please let me know if you have any questions .
regards ,

as i see it , the information below outlines our current turbine position . please could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between north america and south america on the transfer of the mitsubishi turbine for fort pierce , we will be transferring a second turbine across from esa to ena for the homestead project .
i recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for homestead but i assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we reallocate further from esa .
please complete both transfers this week and let john and i know the numbers at which transfer occurred .

texas a & m football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours .
one of the players , while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking , unknown powdery substance on the
practice field . head coach r . c . slocum immediately suspended practice while
the fbi was called in to investigate . after a complete field analysis , the
fbi determined that thewhite substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line . practice resumed when the fbi agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again .

there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership

on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and

dennis vegas and i would like to set up a brief 15 minute meeting with john . experienceenron has already been supporting his commercial team , however , we would like to increase john ' s awareness about the repertoire of services in our group that can potentially help his team achieve their revenue goals . by talking to john , it will also help us understand what opportunities exist in his organization and where we can add value .
dennis and i have been meeting with the wholesale services business unit leaders and would like a few minutes to meet john . if possible we would like to combine a meeting with john and louise , but let us know what john prefers .

14623,fw : netco benefit rate projections,"john ,
the more i look at these comparisons , the more i ' m convinced we have to agree an interim subsidy to let folks down gently and / or a salary adjustment . i think we will lose a very high number of people from this transaction if we don ' t make some accommodation here .
i ' ll call you later today to discuss .
i also need to touch base with you on your salary comment . i need to clarify what you mean by salary freeze . i understood you were ok with us promoting a few people ( 50 or so ) in next 4 / 6 weeks ( so long as we run list passed you first ) and in this regard i would expect to adjust their salaries . we have traditionally raised commercial support salaries ( below vp ) in line with cola ( based on performance but typically around 3 - 4 . 5 % of payroll ) each january and there certainly will be some expectations we will have to deal with .

we have this issue in every deal we do , the benefit coverage is good
overall , but employees pay more for the coverage . it ' s income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits . benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
citigroup and we don ' t want to do anything with subsidy or anything else .
happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp . and ben . philosphy to
deal with the benefits .

john ,
i am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs . perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem . my
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical / dental premiums .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

12088,re : originations schedule,"dear louise and faith
i had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the central maine power deal . the $ 5 mm of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to jeff ader . this value should be allocated to myself and george wood ( woody ) , who worked with me on the deal . as for the appropriate split between me and woody , i think dave duran and ed baughman should make the call on that ( i believe both dave and ed are on holiday this week ) .
in addition , i had one other deal that did not make it next to my name . this deal involved selling icap in nepool to new england power company and had orig value of $ 40 , 000 . i am trying to find a deal number for this . as we discussed faith , it is possible that the deal for $ 40 k under jeff ader ' s name is in fact this deal , in which case this value should be reallocated to me .

enron replaces andrew fastow as cfo amid sec inquiry ( updatel )
( adds statement from enron ' s kenneth lay in second
paragraph . )
houston , oct . 24 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ousted chief
financial officer andrew fastow amid a securities and exchange
commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest
energy trader $ 35 million .
enron named jeff mcmahon , head of its industrial markets
group , as cfo because ` ` it became clear to me that restoring
investor confidence would require us to replace andy , ' ' chairman
and chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement .
fastow will take a leave of absence .
shares of enron , based in houston , fell as much as 22 percent
today after analysts downgraded the stock . the company said on
monday that the sec had begun an inquiry into partnerships fastow
ran .
enron fell $ 3 . 38 , or 17 percent , to $ 16 . 41 , the sixth
straight day of decline . earlier , the shares touched $ 15 . 51 , their
lowest since february 1995 . the stock plunged 21 percent on
monday , after enron disclosed that the sec had requested
information on the partnerships .
the stock fell after lay failed to ease concerns about the
sec inquiry or enron ' s financial reporting in a conference call
yesterday . investors have criticized lay for not disclosing enough
about the workings of investment vehicles such as fastow ' s
partnerships . the stock has fallen 57 percent since oct . 11 ,
losing more than $ 15 billion in market value .

enron shares drop for sixth day on stock downgrades ( update 5 )
( updates with closing share price and fastow on leave of
absence in second paragraph . )
houston , oct . 24 ( bloomberg ) - - shares of enron corp . fell 17
percent after several analysts downgraded the stock and the u . s .
securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into
partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron fell $ 3 . 38 to $ 17 . 08 , dropping for the sixth day in a
row . it was the biggest percentage decline among stocks in the
standard & poor ' s 500 index . earlier , the stock touched $ 15 . 51 ,
the lowest since february 1995 . after the close of regular u . s .
trading , enron said fastow will take a leave of absence , and jeff
mcmahon was named chief financial officer .
chief executive officer kenneth lay failed to ease concerns
about the sec inquiry or enron ' s financial reporting in a
conference call yesterday . investors have criticized lay for not
revealing enough about the workings of investment vehicles such as
fastow ' s partnerships . the stock has fallen 57 percent since oct .
11 , losing more than $ 15 billion in market value .
` ` enron ' s conference call began as a methodical review of
current liquidity and deteriorated into an inadequate defense of
the balance sheet , ' ' lehman brothers analyst richard gross wrote
in a report . he left his ` ` strong buy ' ' rating unchanged .
other analysts lowered their ratings , including carol coale
at prudential securities who downgraded enron to ` ` sell ' ' from
` ` hold . ' ' anatol feygin of j . p . morgan dropped his rating to long -
term ` ` buy ' ' from ` ` buy . ' ' first albany corp . ' s robert christensen
downgraded the stock to ` ` buy ' ' from ` ` strong buy . ' '
possible downgrade
moody ' s investors service last week placed all $ 13 billion of
the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade . a reduction in the rating could cut houston - based enron
off from the commercial paper market , raising the costs of short -
term debt .
enron said earlier this month that dealings with the fastow
partnerships contributed to $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses .
enron has at least 18 such partnerships , which were created to
move debt off its books and lower its tax liabilities as well as
dispose of assets .
an investor has sued enron saying that fastow ' s leadership of
the partnerships , as well as membership on their boards by other
enron executives , is a conflict of interest . the company has $ 3 . 3
billion in potential liabilities attached to such investment
vehicles , the wall street journal reported today .
` ` i don ' t know that we were aware of everything going on with
enron , ' ' said jim walline , manager of the lutheran brotherhood
fund , which owned 93 , 060 shares on sept . 1 . ` ` we had a lot of
confidence and clearly that has been busted a little . ' '

stockwatch enron falls 20 pct on worries deals with ljm will impact earnings
10 / 24 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were sharply lower in afternoon trade , falling over 20 pct , as investors sold the stock a third day running on concerns that financial transactions made with related party ljm could negatively impact future earnings , dealers said .
at 2 . 15 pm , enron was down 4 . 06 usd , or 20 . 52 pct , at 15 . 73 .
the djia was up 9 . 76 points at 9 , 349 . 77 , and the s & p 500 composite index was up 0 . 92 at 1 , 085 . 70 , while the nasdaq composite fell 22 . 42 to 1 , 726 . 96 .
the company confirmed yesterday that the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions .
many analysts responded by cutting the shares ratings on concerns that dealings with the related ljm partnership could affect future earnings , after two class actions were filed against the company yesterday .
the two lawsuits claim that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not credit worthy .
the company ' s operating results were also "" materially overstated as result of the company failure to timely write down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships "" managed by the company ' s cfo .
the suit additionally alleged that enron failed to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap ( generally accepted accounting principles ) .
in its third - quarter results last week , enron announced a charge of 1 . 01 bln usd , or 1 . 11 usd per share , and an incremental 1 . 2 bln usd reduction in stockholders ' equity , related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships .
jp morgan analyst anatol feygin said he has downgraded the stock to a ' long - term buy ' from a ' buy ' in "" the wake of lingering concerns regarding the company ' s credit situation and management disclosure of liabilities stemming from off - balance sheet financing vehicles . ""
the stock has been removed from jp morgan ' s "" focus list "" .
feygin also said that "" management ' s conference call yesterday morning was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns . ""
goldman sachs analyst , david fleischer also agreed that enron ' s disclosure was "" modest "" and "" management did not resolve concerns . ""
however , credit concerns and questions about potential liabilities are "" very much exaggerated , "" he said
"" the real issue will turn out to be huge debt that enron was placing in these entities . ""
the shares ' value have fallen by more than 40 pct since enron reported charges related to investments with ljm last week , but fleischer said he sees no recovery until management fully answers investor questions and restores credibility , an outcome he expects in future weeks .

new york , oct 24 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . plunged further in midday trade on wednesday , hugging the top spot on the list of biggest losers on the new york stock exchange , on concerns whether financial deals made by north america ' s largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect earnings going ahead .
shares were trading down 20 . 87 percent , or $ 4 . 13 , to $ 15 . 66 in midday trade , capping over a 75 percent decline this year in share price . as of tuesday , the company has lost more than $ 10 billion in value in the past week .
some analysts cut ratings or expressed concerns about the former high flyer ' s lack of forthrightness in discussing business deals , unimpressed by management ' s attempts on tuesday to pacify investor concerns about transactions involving enron , its chief financial officer , and two limited partnerships - all of which are being looked into by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
enron on tuesday rejected suggestions the transactions were a conflict of interest , saying the deals were disclosed in sec filings and approved by its board and internal and external auditors .
enron , which reported a loss and a $ 1 . 01 billion in charges for bad investments in the third - quarter , failed to mention a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder value , and was less than forthcoming during a call with analysts and investors the next day .

( c ) copyright federal document clearing house . all rights reserved .
christine romans , cnnfn anchor , market call : now , joining us by phone to talk about his move on enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) is anatol feygin , energy analyst at jp morgan . thank you for joining us .
anatol feygin , jp morgan : thanks for having me .
romans : ok . enron , last week , these shares lost some 28 or 29 percent of their value , continued to fall yesterday , and monday . what ` s going on here why you ` re downgrade - how concerned are you about in visibility management in the issues that we ` re talking about here ?
feygin : well , extremely concerned and until thursday of last week , i felt that a lot the information coming out was old news and was not critical to the fundamentals of the company . on friday of last week the credit market started to really get jittery and spreads on enron ` s credit started to blow out and that could threaten the fundamental business . yesterday management had a opportunity to set the record straight on a conference call . i think that was a big opportunity missed . and until management comes out and reassures the credit markets , primarily , and then the equities markets , there is risk to the fundamental business which i still consider to be the premiere energy marketing and trading franchise that ` s functioning well today , but it at risk because of credit issues .
barry hyman , ehrenkrantz king nussbaum : anatol , what exactly are these off balance sheets financing vehicle , that is of concern here , that management been reluctant to talk about ?
feygin : there are two transaction still left . one called marlin and one called white wing or osprey . in marlin , it ` s basically a 1 / 3 ownership of a u . k water utility that enron acquired in the october of ` 98 . part of that taken public and ` 99 . that was bought back in by enron this year . and problem is that entity , the assets of zurichs , which has this wessex water business in the u . k . , are not enough to payoff the creditors in marlin . so , enron is on the hook for a portion of the equity that has back stopped this investment by marlin . and we estimate that to be in the hundreds of millions not in the billion dollar range , which i think the market fears .
white wing is a very similar structure , less transparent because that ` s a collection of assets . things like , roughly half of enron ` s investment in brazil , its european power plants and et cetera and it ` s difficult to reconcile of what value of those asset is . and there is a possibly that enron have issue up to 2 . 4 billion in equity to make whole the investors in white wing .
romans : ok , anatol feygin , jp morgan , thank you very much . lots of other analysts saying that the conference call with the company didn ` t really clear up some of the questions they had .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones france telecom was unchanged from tuesday at 180 / 195 bps , and deutsche telecom was down about 10 bps at 140 / 150 bps , traders added . vodafone was quoted two basis points lower from late tuesday at 83 / 93 bps , with telefonica put at 100 / 110 bps in five - year default swaps , about five basis points lower .
stronger equity prices helped alleviate some concerns about the telecom sector ' s financial health , although problems remain for many firms labouring under heavy debt burdens , a dealer for a european bank said .
he added that some default swap selling pressure was coming from players arranging synthetic portfolio products such as collateralised debt obligations ( cdos ) before the end of the year . cdos are portfolios of bonds and other debt obligations . the arranger issues bonds , secured by the underlying assets to fund the deal . in a synthetic cdo , the arranger sells default swaps on groups of debt in one hit to mimic the asset pool .
elsewhere , dealers saw small declines in protection costs on the debt of carmakers , with u . s . - german giant daimlerchrysler trading several times .
a u . s . bank dealer nonethless saw it little changed on the day in five - year default swaps at 190 / 200 bps .

enron may need several hundred mln usd to meet shortfalls at investment units
10 / 24 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
london ( afx ) - enron corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more in the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created , the wall street journal reported , citing an interview with enron treasurer ben glisan .
covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares , diluting the position of current shareholders , the paper said .
however , glisan said the company believes it can repay about 3 . 3 bln usd in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock .
the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities - - known as the marlin water trust ii , the marlin water capital corp ii , the osprey trust and osprey i inc . the notes are coming due during the next 20 months .
glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes . also , enron is selling other assets . proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes , which ultimately are guaranteed by enron .
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 2 . 2 bln usd by the end of next year . this amount includes cash proceeds of 1 . 55 bln usd from the previously announced sale of enron ' s portland general electric utility unit .
"" there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds "" to repay the notes , glisan was quoted as saying . "" but if we are wrong , we will issue equity . ""
glisan said a worst - case scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 bln usd in stock . enron said it has about 850 mln shares outstanding .
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron ' s share price . during the past week , shares of the energy - trading giant have dropped more than 40 pct .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones anything more than 9 % is considered ultra - high risk . so while you can make 11 % , that ' s still not enough "" where the accounting is questionable , "" one bond trader says . "" you ' re not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default . you have to worry about your recovery value . ""
not the kind of risk / reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $ 12 . 5 billion with a capital b .
speaking of bonds and stocks : even with its stock at about $ 1 . 16 , global crossing ( gx : nyse - news - commentary ) still has a market cap that exceeds $ 1 billion . but while its stock has rallied , its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar . similar stories can be told for xo communications ( xoxo : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of about $ 473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar ; level 3 communications ( lvlt : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of $ 1 . 2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents ; and mcleodusa ( mcld : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of $ 462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents .
where are opportunistic bond investors , who should be hopping on such cheap debt - - especially bank debt , which is at the top of the getting - paid - back food chain ? they ' re nowhere to be seen , for the same reasons they ' re not jumping to buy enron ' s bonds : too much risk , because when companies like those go bad , their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading . ( try telling that to "" hope - springs - eternal "" stock investors ! )
providian pratfalls : turns out an item here back in may was more fortuitous than it appeared . the item noted how institutional bond investors , who often pony up a slight premium to libor to buy so - called credit default - protection insurance , couldn ' t find any at any price for providian ( pvn : nyse - news - commentary ) . the insurance is sold by investment banks such as j . p . morgan chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade . if nobody ' ll take the other side of the trade - - or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so - - investors should beware . which brings us back to enron : it is possible to buy credit insurance , but at more than a whopping 1 , 000 basis points over libor . hardly a vote of confidence .

accounting irregularities = sell . those three words and an equals sign have always served me well . they remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine , always in view . they have never let me down . when i have deviated from them i have had to pay severely , as i did when i ignored the accounting irregularities in cendant ( cd : nyse - news - commentary ) initially or when , because of my four - month holding period , i couldn ' t sell qwest ( q : nyse - news - commentary ) .
which is why i came in with guns blazing on this enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) , telling you to sell it . the stock has now lost half its value and all i can say is , i still can ' t see why you have to tempt fate and own this one . the notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound , that it has a great core business , is just hokum . who the heck knows ? who has any idea of what this company can really earn ? who knows what it did earn ?
all i know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the democrats that the justice department is playing political favorites by not pursuing enron ( noted republican - giving company ) for alleged fraud .
when that happens , when that shoe drops , wherever enron is , then maybe it is worth some scrutiny .
but i bet i still won ' t like it .

if you disclose something that is wrong , and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed , and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed , is it therefore right ?
that ' s what enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) is asking us to believe . by telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals , they have simply compounded the error . next they will tell us that janus , the largest shareholder , knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises !
what they are doing at enron is , well , positively - - here we go - - ' 80 s ! in the ' 80 s , you had all of these savings - and - loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery . somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher .
nope .
what it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble . the government ended up going after them , too , for abetting the travesties .
enron didn ' t use taxpayers ' money , so it is arguably not as clear - cut . but the more we probe this enron , the more we check it out , the more we know it really stinks and that jeffrey skilling didn ' t leave because the stock got hammered , or some other authentic wall street gibberish , but because of this nasty , unseemly situation .
we don ' t want an sec probe here . we want a justice department probe . this isn ' t about unclear disclosure . this could end up being about fraud .
in the meantime , i wouldn ' t touch this stock with a 10 - foot pole . this one ' s gonna get real nasty before it gets nice . if it ever does .

enron ' s disdain for investors
the motley fool . com
10 / 24 / 01
while recent coverage of enron centers on the cfo ' s past partnerships , a smaller - - and more obvious - - omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company . not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter ' s conference call and press release , something we don ' t like but is prevalent , it also doesn ' t release its balance sheet . the company must think we ' re idiots . they ' re wrong .

october 24 , 2001
enron ' s ( nyse : ene ) > troubles just don ' t stop . on monday , the company announced > that the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) had requested information on "" certain related party transactions > . "" that was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by enron cfo andrew fastow . there has been a flurry - - a hailstorm - - of financial media attention to this . there are only three possibilities , and none is palatable :
the company ' s board allowed this deal in order to - - using corporate speak - - "" incentivize "" the cfo , and it was not legal ;
it was legal , but unethical ; or
enron has been less than forthcoming , perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark .
the accounting machinations involve mind - numbing terms and obfuscation , making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide . the new york times ' floyd norris calls them "" some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen . "" that leads me to one conclusion when i think about burying myself with the company ' s sec filings , accounting texts , my high - speed web connection , and some beer : that of shakespeare ' s king lear - - "" that way madness lies . ""
on the one hand , i know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting , reading financial statements , and finding trouble . ( to read what this is all about , check the "" certain transactions "" section of the company ' s latest proxy statement > . ) i fully intend to do that - - someday . for now , though , all i need to know about enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent .
what ' s worse , though , is that enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark , and not only about the potentially troublesome cfo issue . the company goes out of its way to hide its true financials . that really cheeses me off .
the quarterly call and press release parade
most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases ( for which the companies pay good money to business wire and pr newswire for dissemination ) that allegedly state their latest quarter ' s numbers and talk about the business . sometimes , when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers , execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead . at least thanks to regulation fair disclosure > - - "" reg . fd "" - - analysts don ' t get a secret call with the "" real "" numbers at another time than the public . we like that .
perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers > and ebitda > - - both of which phil weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns - - the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive . that makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of "" bullfeathers ! "" it only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic . the pr department carefully dresses them with spin , leaving the details for the fine print . headline : "" earnings up ! "" ( revenues down 40 % . ) headline : "" revenues up ! "" ( earnings down 40 % . ) the skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness > .
at least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business , but the financials are not helpful . why ?
hiding the cash flow statement
because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time . if the income statement is increasingly unhelpful , at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash , right ? well , not quite .
you really need the cash flow statement - - the best measure of how the company ' s business actually performs . even then , you may need to make further adjustments > . yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time .
check the companies you own . if they don ' t release cash flow statements with their earnings - - or , at least , prior to sec filings , you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so . encourage your fellow investors to do so too , and tell the company that the motley fool sent ya . they will maintain that the numbers aren ' t ready at earnings time . tell them to wait until they are . the numbers are certainly ready in time for the sec deadline , and wouldn ' t we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture ? or , hey , why not do two releases - - one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow ?
if not releasing the cash flow statement were enron ' s only sin , it wouldn ' t be that big a deal . it has plenty of company . but this pre - halloween > scary tale gets worse . unfortunately for enron investors , the company does the hide - the - cash - flow - statement gig one better .
hiding the balance sheet
for at least the last three quarters that i checked , enron hides the balance sheet until sec filing time . that ' s right : not just the cash flow statement , but the balance sheet too . all they release is the income statement - - though , in truth , it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses . but why fail to release the balance sheet ?
the only conclusion can be that management doesn ' t want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into sec filings it thinks people won ' t bother to read . when questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former enron ceo jeffrey skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release , skilling reportedly "" called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners . ""
off his meds that day ? or a symptom of the company ' s attitude towards shareholders ? looks like the latter : skilling ' s gone , but the practice hasn ' t changed .
it ' s about management
we don ' t depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases . a publicly traded company ' s financials will appear a few weeks later through its sec filings available through our quotes & data page > . no investor should be buying - - or holding - - stock in companies if they don ' t read their filings carefully . it ' s hard enough to discern what ' s going on in a business without doing so , and even in those filings - - such as with options grants to management - - the real meat is buried in footnotes . not reading 10 - qs and 10 - ks is like getting married without dating , or buying a car by paint color only .
what enron ' s failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub - par . it says management is willing to hold these events , but it ' ll be darned if it ' ll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management ' s spin . in enron ' s case , its former ceo heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change . does that make enron ' s earnings releases circuses ? draw your own conclusion .
is management listening ? perhaps . it hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday . tmf community member emschulze took notes > :
"" on call , analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company ' s previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance . . . response was that balance sheet doesn ' t normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10 - q to be filed by nov . 14 . . . ceo indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future , implying that investors won ' t have to wait all the way until 10 - q filing deadlines to see balance sheet . ""
that ' s a good sign . but until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time , enron should be in the doghouse .
good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today ' s income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless . if it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together , what ' s the problem ? shareholders should demand no less . when a company trumpets an income statement , as enron has , no one should be surprised when smoke appears . and perhaps much more .
tom jacobs ( tmf tom 9 ) would like to improve his own cash flow statement . at press time , he owned no shares of enron . to see his stock holdings , view his profile > , and check out the motley fool ' s disclosure policy . >

of dowjones newswires
new york - ( dow jones ) - the bonds of embattled enron corp . ( ene ) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader .
the bonds , which carry investment - grade ratings , "" started trading with a dollar price two days ago , "" said gary brown , managing director and head of corporate trading , wachovia securities , charlotte , n . c .
bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80 ' s to low 90 ' s , say traders .
investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable treasury issues . "" credit bonds , "" which have questions about their quality , are traded in dollar quotes , said one analyst .
moody ' s investors service rates the company ' s senior unsecured debt baal , but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade . both standard & poor ' s corp . and fitch rate the debt triple - b - plus .
but the company "" may be going into the double - b ( non - investment grade ) sector , "" said harold rivkin , principal of h . rivkin 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com

usa : group to put corporate directors under microscope .
by kevin drawbaugh
10 / 24 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , oct 24 ( reuters ) - directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group the corporate library , the group ' s cofounder said on wednesday .
in a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country , long - time shareholder activist nell minow said directors will be awarded grades of a , b , c and lower , based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks .
"" it ' s always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds . directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve , "" said minow , who said the service will be called board analyst .
planned as an added feature on an existing web site , . com , board analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year , she said .
only directors of u . s . companies will initially be evaluated . non - u . s . directors may be added later .
minow and partner robert monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights . they formerly managed the washington - based shareholder activist lens fund , which they sold last year to british fund management group hermes .
their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy - side , said industry spokespersons .
"" there ' s been growing interest within our membership in board membership , in general , and individual directors , in particular . i definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors , "" said ann yerger , spokeswoman for the council of institutional investors , which represents america ' s large pension funds .
the corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970 s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible . many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors . but examples of lax board oversight still abound .
one example would be enron corp . , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the securities and exchange commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company ' s chief financial officer , minow said .
"" where was the enron board in all of this ? "" she asked . "" boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these . that apparently didn ' t happen here . ""
taking the corporate governance argument a step further , minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question . it should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company .
"" this isn ' t just a corporate governance thing . this is part of investment analysis , "" she said .
institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks . whether they will begin to examine directors , as well , remained an open question .
"" nell and bob monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction , "" said peter gleason , vice president of research and development at the national association of corporate directors , which represents more than 3 , 000 corporate directors .
surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self - evaluation high on their list of concerns . "" more and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing , "" gleason said .

12622,re : enymex,"would there be any interest in using the auction functions on eol for this product instead of a product line ? there is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules - - reserve prices or not , sale commitment or not , timing , etc . - - and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them . i assume we are only showing one side of this market .

brad ,
we may consider targeting a wide audience . since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities , our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse . our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $ 31 mm ( plus option fees ) .
i have two primary documents . one is the spec sheet and a general scope . the other is a turbine purchase agreement .
a counterparty can have two options : one is to contact us to provide a bid . there would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case . their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract . for $ 1 mm , they would have a 30 day call on the turbines , during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence . the $ 1 mm buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period .
it may be a nuance , but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine . is this consistent with eol ' s format ?

armed with a target list of purchasers , we can craft the new product pop - up to hit those companies ' systems when they log on , which would give them the following information :
general description of the assets
contact information ( names thome , stephen ; taylor , mark e ( legal )
subject : re : enymex
ah - ha !
the turbines idea on eol . i don ' t want to post an advetisement only i want them to post the turbines themselves . so essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product . they have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the abbs we actually have in canada . you never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non - binding as there would be site inspections etc .
but not an advert - actually posting the turbines .

bob shults and i will be attending an enymex reception this thursday , and john and greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with bo and vincent . short answer - - we ' ve got it as covered as possible for now .
another item : i got a call from stephen thome in ena who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on enrononline . jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop - up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets . i ' m told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle , so to speak . i think it fits well for the turbines , but i wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development .

i recently met robert "" bo "" collins , the new president of the nymex and formerly with el paso . bo is keenly aware that the nymex has fallen down in two areas - - first , catering too much to the locals , while ignoring their true customer base and secondly , not following through with the enymex rollout . bo along with vincent viola , the new chairman of the nymex are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately . personally , i think there is a chance that enrononline could partner with the nymex and it could benefit both . obviously , they need us far more than we need them , but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the nymex management . is this something of interest and if so , should we follow up ? bo and vince will be in houston in late august for a nymex cocktail party at rocc and i could arrange a meeting at enron .",-1

at their website briefly and thought you might be interested . i have also
forwarded some email correspondence between dr . stoll and joe gordon , one of
our associates and a former student of his at owen school . we have been very
successful lately in recruiting at vanderbilt , both at the undergrad and mba
levels , and have gotten some high quality people . please let me know if you
have any interest in this and i would be glad to follow up with dr . stoll or

joe ,
thanks for your note .
the purpose of the fmrc is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research , real world issues and regulation .
members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center . they send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences . our center is unique in its mix of academics , practitioners and
regulators . for members , such as enron , it provides a window on the academic
world , and would give enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities .
more information on the center can be found at
http : / / mba . vanderbilt . edu / fmrc /
center members include , nyse , nasdaq , cme , some high tech trading firms ,
merrill lynch . . . .
joining the center usually requires a top management decision , but i would
approach it through the research and the trading areas . one way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year ' s conference on april 13 - 14 . the program is on the web
site . ( membership is $ 10 , 000 per year )
appreciate your interest and help .
let me know if we should provide more detail to someone .
regards ,
hans

sorry for the delay , but we haven ' t forgotten about your interest in having
enron participate in the fmrc . our holdup is determining who is the
appropriate contact person at enron ( that , and neglect ) . we ' re not sure if
we should approach someone from trading , research , senior management , etc .
also , any additional information on the role the participating firms play
would be helpful .

kevin ,
if you guys had aerons ( mesh ) and / or vecta ( leather ) chairs , my group
typically will not be responsible for the replacement of those chairs as i ' m
not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone . my group
does not stock these chairs , therefore we order as requested by business
units and charge your co / rc . there will be two chairs delivered to the
locations mentioned below , however , they will not be the vecta or aeron
chairs .
you may want to contact enron security and maybe they can investigate further .

washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - following are comments
made this morning by senate majority leader tom daschle when asked
about the collapse of enron corp . :
` ` we ' re certainly going to try to find answers to
the questions involving the collapse of enron . i don ' t know that
anybody knows yet just how this happened and how it happened so
quickly .
` ` i think we need to find as much information as is possible
and make some assessment about whether it ' s indicative of energy
in a larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it .
but clearly it raises some very serious questions . ' '

2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 25 ( new york )
enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed
houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed
construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown
houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the
fallout from enron ' s financial troubles .
trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story
tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow
spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week .
` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty
associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space
springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to
delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' '
matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development
operations , said in a statement .
enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for
bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc .
abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and
analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million
square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder
time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said .
about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s
downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was
planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space ,
and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball
team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which
reported the delay earlier .
houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 -
story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to
its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for
power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker
insignia / esg ' s houston office .
` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look
five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy
rates could double , ' ' said collins .
other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 -
square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000
square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will
be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia .

inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional
natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and
credit to run through the second quarter .

next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar
said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy
gas for winter inventories next year , she said .

will continue to deliver to customers .

quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end
of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is

new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange
president j . robert collins told floor members they could not
accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written
authorization from an exchange clearing member .
a fax from collins to member firms today said the order was
effective immediately and that it would ` ` remain in effect until
further notice from the exchange . ' '
clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on
the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options .
the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its
natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of
trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the
exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure
obligations will be met .
while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the
decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the
swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron ,
once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron
might be forced into bankruptcy .
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one
of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to
being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 -
month foray into markets for copper and similar products .
possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore
international ag and the current management of the company ,
traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies
couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal
business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful
deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers
administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on
the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' '
traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would
be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron
corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the
metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said .
enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445
million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit
of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation
upon which that german construction , engineering and trading
company was built .
it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal
exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned
commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its
warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the
direction of metals prices .
declining market
the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz
schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied
speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international
fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading
operation .
hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month
it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such
as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to
meet demand from its customers .
any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand
its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and
metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring
dealer , or floor trader , on the lme .
whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty
substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be
the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' '
the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals
market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this
year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from
users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid
slowing economies .
the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a
member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted
scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova
scotia to leave the lme ring .
the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring
dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry
trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive
electronic trading .
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is
owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about
$ 100 million .
deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to
enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount .
europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below
100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman
for deutsche bank .
commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less
than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said .
dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default ,
and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the
year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek .
the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy
protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed
merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some
of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt .
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york )
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to
file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy
inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled
with more than $ 15 billion in debt .
enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
partnerships .
the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new
restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange
barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without
special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading
was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products .
a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record
$ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim
what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets .
` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of
deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron .
` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things
out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' '
duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and
a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion
combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas
companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of
yesterday .
in london , was appointed administrator
of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating
companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter
11 papers in the u . s .
enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value
in the last six months .
lawyers
enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which
has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone
group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of
restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but
declined to comment further .
chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the
company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a
provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt -
collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the
company .
` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved
company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean
of the university of houston law center .
thousands affected
an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people ,
including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers ,
suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised
recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in
the company ' s liquidation .
in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a
nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns
portland general electric , which generates and distributes power
to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s
enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic
communications network .
chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
contracts and unprofitable leases .
` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away
from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also
publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations .
recovery
the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a
company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan
typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a
bankruptcy judge for final approval .
the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various
classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy
code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their
claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as
bondholders and suppliers .
financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be
particularly difficult to produce .
` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a
bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard &
zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
advice by enron bondholders .
shareholders
enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line
to get paid .
enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in
afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the
company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a
scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 .
enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the
company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in
2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said .
at that price the notes yield 53 percent .
some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker
with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for
advice by enron bondholders .
` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky .
potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers
and directors .
` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going
to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said .
liability
dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase
of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy .
enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline .
the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was
proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5
billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the
lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s
decision .
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors
turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be
able to pay its debts .
three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit
rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s
debt obligations .
unraveling
enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said
shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the
way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the
announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s .
securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating
earnings for almost five years .
as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence
the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners
such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or
restricted trading with the company .
` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s
going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' '
enron ' s overseas assets could complicate bankruptcy

dow jones emerging markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - as enron corp . ( ene ) teeters on the edge of insolvency , its creditors , power industry players and even foreign governments are angling to lay claim to the company ' s assets .
in an example of how far the ripples are being felt , the brazilian government said thursday it ' s legally entitled to seize enron ' s assets in that country if the u . s . energy titan files for bankruptcy .
the houston - based company has more than $ 60 billion in assets , a little more than 10 % of which are considered "" non - core "" or located overseas . indeed , of enron ' s 10 , 453 megawatts in total power production , 8339 mw are generated internationally .
as it established a presence in dozens of countries , enron also diversified into oil and gas exploration and production , power generation , and even non - energy related businesses such as forest products , metals and steel , broadband and credit evaluation systems .
although enron ' s non - core and global forays haven ' t on the whole been profitable , there is value in some of the hard assets .
and while it ' s not clear whether or how claims by foreign governments on enron assets would be honored , it ' s certain the company ' s myriad overseas holdings will further addle what would likely be a vastly complex bankruptcy proceeding .
the following is an overview of a number of those holdings outside the north american continent , according to some of the most recent data provided by the company , which didn ' t , however , specify the extent of its equity interests or operational control in the majority of the assets listed .
approximately 70 % of enron ' s assets outside north america and europe are located in central and south america and the caribbean :
- - - brazil : enron controls electricity distributor elektro eletricidade e servico sa ( e . eko ) , which was acquired in 1998 for brrl . 479 billion ( $ 1 = brr 2 . 48 ) . it also owns two gas - fired thermoelectric plants : eletrobolt , with a capacity of 380 megawatts , and cuiaba , with a 480 - mw capacity .
enron also owns important stakes in natural gas distributor companhia distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro ( e . cdr ) , or ceg , and its smaller unit ceg - rio .
in late april , brazil ' s oil giant petroleo brasileiro ( pbr ) , or petrobras , agreed to pay $ 240 million for the stake enron owns in ceg . petrobras agreed to buy the 25 . 38 % stake the u . s . energy group owns in ceg as well as the 33 . 75 % stake enron has in ceg - rio . the deal is still seen closing in the next few days .
- - - puerto rico : enron has been poised to sell in the weeks ahead a 49 % interest in the 507 mw ecoelectrica power plant and liquified natural gas terminal for about $ 250 million .
it ' s also involved in a 20 , 000 metric ton liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal and the san juan gas distribution company , which has a capacity to carry approximately 400 , 000 cubic feet a day .
- - - bolivia : enron is an operator on the bolivian side of the 3 , 000 kilometer bolivia - to - brazil natural gas pipeline , and holds a small 4 % interest on the brazilian side .
- - - argentina : enron has an interest in transportadora de gas del sur , a 5 , 005 kilometer pipeline .
- - - venezuela : enron , in cooperation with vengas , is involved in a leading transporter and distributor of lpg , among other assets .
- - - colombia : enron has stakes in the centragas pipeline , a 578 km natural gas transmission system , and promigas , a top natural gas company .
- - - panama : enron holds a 355 mw electricity generation plant .
- - - guatemala : enron has two power plants with combined generating capacity of 234 mw .
- - - dominican republic : enron has a 185 mw power facility .
the company also has a sizeable footprint in asia , particularly in india :
- - - india : about 14 % of enron ' s international assets are located in india , home to its mammoth $ 3 billion dabhol power project , which has a generation capacity of 2184 mw .
enron is also poised to sell its offshore india oil 201 - 938 - 2226 ; charles . roth @ dowjones . com

usa : ice electronic energy trade soars on enron woes .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , an atlanta - based electronic energy and metals marketplace , said on thursday that trade on its system in late november was up 65 percent from october .
ice has been setting new trading records in recent weeks , as concerns over energy trader enron corp . ' s crumbling credit rating diverted on - line business to the exchange .
enron suspended operations of enrononline , ice ' s main rival for internet - based trading , on wednesday after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , killing a potential takeover by dynegy inc . .
enron , which said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its electronic trading system , said it reopened enrononline thursday to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
until this month , enron was by far the nation ' s largest trader in north american natural gas and electricity , with industry analysts estimating it was involved in some 25 percent of all daily trade in those markets .
in addition to increased volumes , ice has also seen a big jump in the number of users tapping into the system , up 30 percent from october , the exchange said in a statement .
"" over the past couple of weeks we have experienced an increase in total volumes and registered users , "" said jeffrey sprecher , chief executive officer of ice .
"" we believe the inherent credit concerns in the otc ( over - the - counter ) market have spawned interest in a many - to - many trading platform as opposed to a one - to - many platform .
sprecher also said ice would continue to look for ways to expand its trading platform to accommodate new participants .
as an open - access marketplace , intercontinental exchange now has over 400 commodity trading firms participating .
the ice electronic trading system is now installed on over 7 , 500 desktops worldwide , a 7 percent gain in the past two weeks .
products traded on ice include natural gas , power , crude oil and refined products , precious metals and emissions allowances .
intercontinental exchange has offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore and is owned by over 100 energy and metals traders , brokers and bankers .

enron corp . stood at the abyss of bankruptcy on thursday , as its european arm filed for creditor protection and creditors assessed their exposure to one of the world ' s biggest - ever corporate collapses .

london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - british day - ahead electricity prices slumped on thursday as traders dumped power onto the market after cutting ties with troubled enron .
day - ahead electricity was trading down to 15 pounds per megawatt hour from 26 . 5 pounds on wednesday .

us power , gas markets remain orderly despite enron exit

new york - ( dow jones ) - trading in u . s . natural gas and electricity markets generally remained orderly thursday , and price movements continued to be muted , despite the exit of one - time market leader enron corp . ( ene ) .
some gas markets , however , saw more volatility as a result of enron ' s absence , traders said , and some electricity prices seemed stronger than justified by fundamentals , perhaps a result of buying by traders covering their exposure to enron . the moves weren ' t dramatic .
"" it ' s almost business as usual , "" one power trader said .
enron wasn ' t presenting a full range of prices on its internet - based platform enrononline thursday , although traders said enron was briefly making markets for some products .
traders , who for the most part aren ' t doing business with the company , attributed the activity to last - minute efforts by some energy companies to flatten their positions with enron and the energy giant ' s own efforts to close its positions .
"" there ' s a lot of unwinding going on , "" a trader said .
the new york mercantile exchange , the world ' s largest energy futures exchange , advised its floor members thursday morning not to accept orders placed directly to the trading floor by enron or enron affiliates without written authorization from a clearing member carrying an enron account .
the exit of a company that once accounted for a quarter of the north american power and gas markets has produced substantial changes in the way business is done in the energy markets .
traders used to transacting on enrononline were spending more time on the phone or turning to platforms like that run by , an electronic marketplace founded by a consortium of energy and financial companies . traders accustomed to looking to enrononline for pricing guidance were left to figure out the market for themselves .
the result was abnormally high volatility in the physical gas markets , particularly on gas for delivery in the next month , a trader said .
gas for delivery in december at southern california ' s topak hub was trading in a range of $ 1 . 95 to $ 2 . 55 per million british thermal units , the trader said . december gas at the san juan basin was trading at $ 1 . 70 - $ 2 . 44 .
"" traders aren ' t sure where they should be trading , "" the trader said .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
san francisco , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered energy giant enron corp . said on thursday it had reopened its widely used electronic trading system to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
the company also said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its enrononline ( eol ) system , which until this month was by far the most liquid marketplace for trading north american electricity and natural gas .
"" enrononline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage enron credit exposure , "" a message posted on the trading system said .
the message warned that "" while transactions may be available , customers entering into transactions should carefully evaluate their positions and enron ' s current credit status before transacting . ""
enron spokesman eric thode confirmed enrononline - which recently accounted for up to 60 percent of enron ' s business - restarted operations late wednesday .
the internet - based eol trading platform was shut earlier wednesday after credit rating agencies cut enron ' s debt to "" junk "" status .
thode also said the company had "" no plans "" to cease operations on enrononline after parties have closed all outstanding positions .
the system also carries products for trading various commodities like metals , pulp and paper .

frankfurt , nov 29 ( reuters ) - german electricity prices jumped around widely on thursday , while year 2002 firmed by up to 35 eurocents due to uncertainty over the value of long - term contracts with crisis - hit counterparty enron .
enron ' s liquidity crisis reached a head on thursday when the firm announced that its european arm had filed for creditor protection .
"" prices were jumpy today , which was in part due to uncertainty with enron , "" a trader said .
"" but enron has actually been tapering off its volumes further out for a while now , so the market didn ' t really miss any big volumes from them today , "" he added .
day ahead baseload traded at 31 . 5 - 33 euros , with an early high of 35 euros and a mid - session low of 29 . 5 euros , while peakload traded at 39 . 75 - 42 . 25 euros , after peaking at 45 euros and troughing at 39 . 75 euros .
week ahead was rangebound at 29 . 75 - 31 euros , while peakload changed hands at 41 . 5 - 44 euros in quiet trading .
december baseload traded at 27 . 6 euros , before retracing to its wednesday range of 26 . 65 - 26 . 7 euros , while january baseload traded at 26 . 65 - 27 . 1 , also steady with previous levels .
year 2002 firmed to 22 . 75 from 22 . 4 euros , before falling back down to 22 . 45 and last traded at 22 . 35 - 55 .
"" this was all on speculation about enron and on covering their long - term postions since delivery is now not guaranteed beyond friday , "" a dealer said .

berlin - ( dow jones ) - while some european mutual funds may be stuck holding enron inc . ( ene ) shares or bonds , their exposure appears fairly limited , with a number of fund companies saying they already sold off their holdings in recent months .
nevertheless , a few funds said they had some exposure in stock or bonds to the company , which stopped most trading wednesday after standard & poor ' s downgraded its credit rating to "" junk "" and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) abandoned plans for a buyout .
fund manger helle bendorff with bg invest in copenhagen said at the end of october , bg invest ' s international corporate bond fund had 6 . 1 million kroner , or 3 . 2 % , invested in enron corporate bonds , out of a total fund of dkkl 95 million ( $ 1 = dkk 8 . 3652 ) .
"" naturally when something like this happens anyone can see it will take its toll on returns , "" said bendorff . however , she wouldn ' t give further details .
enron ' s 4 3 / 8 bonds dated 2005 were trading around 20 cents to the dollar thursday , down from over 50 cents before the buyout fell through . the collapse of the dynegy deal leaves enron bondholders holding about $ 13 billion in debt versus an unknown base of assets .
analysts widely expect enron to file for insolvency protection , and its liquidation value will be the focus for bondholders . bondholders are therefore more likely to get something back than investors who are left holding stocks .
in contrast with u . s . counterparts , most european stock funds ' exposure appears fairly low , however , and any hit to their value was probably already taken in the last months .
fund managers and spokespeople at a number of european fund houses that had been known to have holdings in enron shares in the past said they sold off those assets in recent months and weeks .
a spokesman at dutch funds company ohra beleggingen beheer bv said the fund sold its enron holdings at the end of october . they had comprised around 4 . 7 % of its eur 20 million new energy fund and were also included in some other funds , according to funds tracking company morningstar . he said they took a loss on the investment , but stressed they still unwound their holdings on time .
a fund manager at denmark ' s uni - invest said the firms electronic business unit trust had sold off its holdings in enron prior to the current troubles . as of the end of september the unit trust had held 3 . 6 % of its assets in enron stock . the size of the unit trust is dkk 585 million , the manager said .
dresdner bank ' s dit funds arm also sold off all its enron holdings in its energie fonds after the company ' s third - quarter earnings report , a spokesman said , as did ubs ' ag ' s ef - energy fund .
european energy funds tend to be rather small , so even if the fund is highly exposed , it ' s unlikely to have any market impact . the largest energy funds are only several hundred million euros , for example .
in the u . s . , the picture was somewhat different .
enron may have been held by some major u . s . funds , according to the funds ' most recent securities and exchange commission filings . those include fmr corp . ' s ( x . fin ) fidelity investments , stilwell financial inc . ' s ( sv ) janus capital corp . , alliance capital management ( ac ) and putnam investments . vanguard group inc . ( x . vgi ) held the stock in various portfolios , including its giant passively managed index funds , according to its filings .
the $ 11 billion alliance premier growth fund had about 4 % of its assets in enron shares as of sept . 30 , according to morningstar . based on the sept . 30 filing , the fund ' s stake had dropped in value by about $ 445 million through wednesday . a spokeswoman for janus said the company ' s mercury fund , which had 3 . 6 % of its assets invested in enron stock on april 30 , had disposed of all its enron shares by mid - november .
many of the stock funds in europe that are still holding enron funds also reduced their weightings considerably in recent months , according to their representatives .
a spokesman for u . k . - based investec said the company is still holding some enron stock , but wouldn ' t give specific data . morningstar listed the global privatization fund and the wired index fund as holders of enron stock , but investec ' s web site doesn ' t list the funds in the top 10 holdings .
"" our enron positions in each of these funds is less than 3 % - it ' s a non - material exposure . we cut our loss positions about two months ago , and we were underweight even before that for a year now , "" he said . "" the wired index fund tracks the wired index ( a u . s . new - economy index ) and enron is a constituent of that , so our holding is the constituent portion . ""
separately , standard and poor ' s said enron will be removed from its sdow jones newswires ; 49 - 302888410

enron metals trading staff say bnp , coke metals , hsbc rumoured possible buyers

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp ' s metal trading division has sparked some interest from potential buyers with rumours from the company ' s own trading floor putting bnp paribas , coke metals group , hsbc banking group and goldman sachs & co inc in the frame , an enron metals trader said .
he added that employees have not yet received any information from management on the future of the troubled energy giant following news from london this morning that enron ' s european office has gone into administration .
"" everybody showed up for work today , it ' s still a working entity but we ' ve had no word , no internal memos as yet , "" the employee told afx news . "" we ' re completely in the dark . ""
according to reports , an official from administrator has said there is strong interest in the company ' s metals trading division , sparking speculation within the company of potential acquirers , he said .
parties rumoured to be interested in acquiring the division include bnp paribas , coke metals , hsbc and goldman sachs .
"" enron still has a membership of the london metals exchange which is of interest to banks who want to get back into the business , "" said the employee , who requested anonymity .
"" it ' s not the only asset that would be of interest though . the pipeline and fact that ( enron ) has warehousing should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars . ""
enron , which employs a total of 21 , 000 people , has been flooded with phone calls all morning from customers seeking information on the company ' s plans .
"" for now , we ' re still optimistic that a solution will be found and we won ' t lose our jobs , "" said the employee .
analysts are expecting enron to file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc yesterday terminated their merger agreement and the company ' s ratings were reduced to junk status .
the stock , which lost 85 pct of its value yesterday , has been forced out of the s & p 500 .

usa : dynegy cites deterioration in enron operations .
11 / 29 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 29 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . chairman and chief executive chuck watson on thursday said disclosures by enron corp . of further deterioration in its operations led dynegy to pull out of a deal to acquire the beleaguered energy trading giant and keep it afloat .
a nov . 19 filing with regulators showed that enron faced insurmountable problems both in the long term and the short term , causing dynegy to invoke "" material adverse change "" clauses allowing it to pull out of its agreement to acquire enron , watson said in an interview with cnbc television .
announcements on wednesday by credit - rating agencies that they had downgraded enron debt to junk status also played a key role in dynegy ' s decision , he said .
watson said dynegy is confident that it will take control of enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline unit next month under a clause of the acquisition agreement that allowed it to keep the 16 , 500 miles of pipeline if the deal collapsed .
enron has said it will contest dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . senate majority leader tom daschle said on thursday that congress should find out what brought one - time energy giant enron corp . to the brink of bankruptcy , and see if it has broader ramifications for the energy industry .
"" we certainly need to try to find answers to the questions involving the collapse of enron , "" the south dakota democrat told reporters .
"" i think we need to find as much information as possible , and make some assessments of whether it ' s indicative of energy in the larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it . but clearly , it raises some very serious questions , "" daschle said .
activity at many enron units in more than 40 countries around the world ground to a halt this week . the global giant employs 21 , 000 people in operations ranging from marketing electricity and natural gas to delivering commodities such as metals , coal , pulp and paper .
house energy and commerce committee chairman billy tauzin said on wednesday he did not see a way for the government to try to rescue enron , which was near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
"" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , "" said tauzin , a louisiana republican .

enron crisis hits four japanese money mgmt funds - nikkei

tokyo ( nikkei ) - - the reverberations of the crisis at u . s . energy trading giant enron corp . are starting to shake japanese investors , the nihon keizai shimbun reported in its friday morning edition .
with enron now on the edge of bankruptcy , money management funds managed by nikko asset management co . and three other fund companies fell below their par value of yl 0 , 000 thursday due to losses on enron bonds .
the money management funds have apparently fallen 0 . 5 % to 7 % under par value , a significant loss of principal given that the funds total more than y 3 trillion in size .
japan has experienced two previous cases of money management funds falling under their face value , but the losses were smaller in scale .
the four fund companies are being besieged with redemptions by nervous investors anxious to retrieve their money . nikko asset management , for example , has reportedly received requests for redemptions totaling more than yl trillion out of a total fund balance of y 2 . 7 trillion .
japan investment trust management co . and sumisei global investment trust management co . , two of the other firms hit by losses on enron bonds , also received redemption requests equivalent to nearly 30 % of total fund assets . the fourth firm affected was ufj partners asset management co .
jittery investors , meanwhile , are asking other fund companies , even those not affected by the enron crisis , to disclose their asset holdings in money management funds .
in response , shinko investment trust management co . has drawn up plans to send to brokers materials disclosing all holdings in its money management fund and a medium - term government bond investment fund .
daiwa asset management co . is also considering ways to beef up disclosure for what is the largest money management fund in the industry .
analysts and industry executives are expressing concern that the declines below the par value could cause investors to rethink the safety of money management funds . these funds have been marketed as ultrasafe investment vehicles and a good alternative to bank deposits when a cap on deposit insurance protection is reimposed in april next year . with interest rates continuing to languish at extremely low levels , some fund managers have been tempted to add riskier corporate bonds to their holdings in an attempt to pump up fund yields .
money management funds had more than yl 8 trillion in assets as of the end of october , accounting for about one - third of assets in all investment trusts .

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - the corporate bond market is signaling its anticipation of an imminent bankruptcy filing by beleaguered energy services company enron corp . ( ene ) .
there is a 22 - 1 / 2 bid both for bonds maturing in 2003 and 2009 . and neither bid is with accrued interest .
the combination of the bonds trading without accrued interest , or flat , and the withering of the normal gap in price between shorter - and longer - dated maturities means the market believes "" the company is probably going into bankruptcy , "" said tom haag , senior analyst in charge of distressed securities , lutheran brotherhood , minneapolis .
by trading flat , investors are saying that they do not expect to receive any further interest payments from enron . and the sameness of price , regardless of maturity , signals that the market believes all the bonds will be treated the same in a bankruptcy proceeding , said haag .
normally , bond prices reflect greater risk of repayment for longer - dated maturities .
on wednesday , before standard & poor ' s and the two other major ratings agencies downgraded enron to speculative grade from investment grade , enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % coupon bonds maturing in 2003 were being offered at a price of $ 59 with accrued interest , traders said .
after the downgrades , prices fell into the 20 s but the bonds were still quoted with accrued interest , said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

5439,benefits - personal days,"vince :
is the following all right to send to the group ?
* * * * * * * *
good morning all :
the question has arisen as to whether enron has "" personal days "" , that ,
you can take in case of repair problems at home ; car problems ; sick spouse ,
sick child , etc .
i checked with hr and the policy manual and the answer is "" no "" , but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor . i talked this over
with vince and he has decided that the research group will be allowed
two ( 2 ) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day , discretionary day , or leave of absence .
if you have advance notice ( such as an air conditioner repair scheduled ) ,
please let me know when you are going to take these days . if an
emergency arises with no notice , please call in and let me know that you
are taking a personal day . it will be coded on your time sheet .
these two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of , "" funeral
leave "" , "" family leave "" , or "" civic duty leave "" . they are just a way of being
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise .
these should be very beneficial and i am sure very much appreciated by
all of us .
if you have any questions , please call me .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

in the governance email which you sent , mike bridges was identified as a member of the operational restart sub - committee . i assume you meant mark bridges .
i suspect this might have lead to mike receiving a phonecall today from ubs asking him for information .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

tana expressed concern last night that sally beck ' s world doesn ' t seem to have much direction and with bob hall deciding not to go to netco , there is a lot of talk / speculation about why he is not going .
just wanted to bring this to your attention - lavo asked that we add sally back on the netco list , but then said for us not to tell her . i think with bob ' s departure , we need to identify and communicate who the lead is so that the team can be given direction and get things back on track .
let me know your thoughts - any help that you can give would be greatly appreciated .

ponderosa pine energy , llc .
mazowita and farmer to work with plant manager ( mike gough ) to determine :
how power schedules are received from brazos and translated into fuel
requirements
the plant ' s operating flexibility to use fuel oil over natural gas
how the use of fuel oil is built into the dispatch / operation decision
the degree to which the plant has historically been involved with fuel
suppliers beyond tgc ( i . e . , apache , williams , lone star )
mazowita and farmer to work with tgc ( nancy stivers ) to determine :
how gas schedules are received from the plant
why there were structural differences between the apache / williams fuel supply
agreements and the tgc agency agreement
tgc ' s experience with optimizing value under the fuel supply agreements
farmer to determine if a "" form agreement "" is available within ena for
transactions of this nature
lyons / hill to determine ( a ) if there is a need to have the gas agency
agreement at the project vs . holding company level and ( b ) if bank approvals
are needed as a result of the new agreement
lyons / mazowita / farmer to draft agency agreement
griffith to determine the best means of handling "" duel fuel "" capability at
the plant within ena

14960,portland office,"my name is tim belden and i manage the west power trading desk in portland . louise kitchen suggested that i get in touch with you .
i spoke to marcus beurgler on tuesday about the portland office . i indicated to him our desire to move . we discussed an interim period in this office until we can move elsewhere . i learned yesterday that enron has accepted the lease on this office space . i was not aware that this was happening and am told that we are now stuck here for the term of the lease which is three to five years .
based on very preliminary assessment it looks like it may be cost effective to move from here . we currently occupy 20 , 000 square feet when we only need roughly 10 , 000 . if we remain in this building there is a significant cost associated with physically separating our phones and computers from portland general electric . everyone here would like to move .
what i need to know is the following :
is ubs warburg obligated at this point in time to take on the lease for our current space ? if yes , can this be undone ? if no , when will this decision be made ?
if we are obligated to take this space , who do i need to talk to within ubs about negotiating with portland general electric to get out of the lease . i have very good relationships with portland general electric so i think that they would work with us on this .
i can be reached at 503 - 464 - 3820 or 503 - 701 - 7278 .

2339,tenaska iv 11 / 00,"i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .
1 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 1 demand fee from $ 341 , 250 . 47 to $ 493 , 365 . 74

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .

22845,re : project doorstep responsibility matrix,"thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments
arrive too late . here they are anyway :
1 socrates
i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have
primary responsibility for this system / project .
but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this
project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in
history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart .
2 exhaustive ?
it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such .
3 symptoms or causes ?
many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will
likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is
applied .
in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 :
"" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality . . . ""
because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation
errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think
about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move
on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they
did .
i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on
microsoft excel all day , everyday .
4 overall
i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking
off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate .
as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality ?

jean ,
as you know we have had several meetings with marathon at various levels to discuss mainly offshore projects . our initial meetings were with senior management to discuss deepwater projects and utilization of existing marathon infrastructure . david golder , sr . vp commercialization and development , was the highest level marathon executive that at we have had discussions . most recently , i have contacted pat kuntz , vp natural gas and crude oil sales , to set up a luncheon and discuss enron ' s decision to not pursue deepwater infrastructure transactions and introduce the producer one product . this seemed like a reasonable way to introduce the producer one product and close out the deepwater business with marathon . over the past nine months we have had several meetings and a dinner party over the christmas holidays . if you are going to meet with some of the same marathon senior management that we have had previous discussions it might be desirable to have ken or i present for continuity .
thanks . . . kevin

11176,california update 3 / 15 / 01,"executive summary
? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for past utility debt
? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short for pg & e this summer
? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs
? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions for california
california public utility commission rate increases
today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption , but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr , which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10 billion worth of state bonds .
davis & pg & e at odds
sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) , and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would provide davis with even less negotiating power .
with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation . davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .
qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy
sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .
out with hebert , in with wood
the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood . the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and power plant installation .
it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as bpa .",-1

i ' ve attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to unify for
november . please don ' t let this alarm you , this is how the bridge has always
worked . if you have questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
every instance i ' ve found looks okay because of the following :
* a transport ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* the deal didn ' t have a point assigned to it , only a zone

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

subject : crown energy
i spoke with oscar wyatt this afternoon on crown and subsequently to tom bachtell , an attorney in utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management . crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast utah and an asphalt distribution company . bachtell owns about 4 - 5 % of the stock . mr . wyatt indicated he had a "" small "" holding . i indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment .
we hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $ 5 . 5 million in 1997 . fully converted , our ownership would be approximately 25 % . the company has a net deficit of $ 21 million and a "" going concern "" paragraph in its audit opinion . we have written down our carrying value to nil .
the company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against mcn energy and mcnic pipeline . mcnic has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to crown . mcnic attempted to foreclose on certain crown assets and crown in turn counter - sued for $ 100 million . the arbitration hearing will be held july 23 - august 10 . if crown obtained an award from the arbitration , some value could be restored to our investment .
we will get further information from bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position enron should take in this matter .",-1

28207,allegheny energy,"more info on allegheny . apparently , they ' re taking funds derived from the
forced
divestiture of their utility based generating assets and using them to
purchase
new ipp plants . allegheny ( as reported recently ) is looking at building a
plant in the
palo verde area .
allegheny buys enron plants
allegheny energy supply , the unregulated
generation unit of maryland - based allegheny
energy , showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider , buying gas - fired plants from
enron that serve three regions .
financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed , but allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by enron north
america : the 546 - mw gleason plant in gleason ,
tenn . ; the 508 - mw wheatland plant in
wheatland , ind . ; and the 656 - mw lincoln energy
center in manhattan , ill .
allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations , announcing
plans to build a 1 , 080 - mw unit in arizona .
the three plants being acquired from enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in midwest markets , which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area . all three entered
commercial operation in june 2000 .
don feenstra , vice president of new
projects at allegheny energy supply , said the
acquisitions fit with the company  , s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
( about 8 , 200 mw ) in five years . the three enron
plants total 1 , 710 mw , swelling allegheny  , s portfolio
to more than 12 , 000 mw . once the first goal
is reached , allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50 % in a second five - year
period . feenstra said the enron plants all can be
converted to combined - cycle for use over ex - tended
periods .",-1

1 . the best split is probably just 50 / 50 on personnel . while everyone is in a specific box on the org chart , many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles . the $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward ( for example , if ees wants something specific on a state puc matter ) .
2 . in terms of approving outside service expenditures , i would like to sit down with you , louise , and rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals . i will try and set up some time the first week of december .
4 . i have put steve montovano in the ne gas box . this will increase the budget by $ 400 k ( based on historical figures ) . i have attached a new org chart to represent this change .
also , dan staines ( who is not on the org chart ) has an employment contract that ends 6 / 12 / 2002 . dan has been working on florida and northeast rto matters and continues to help east power with the nyiso tcc auction . we can sever him , but his contract will need to be paid off ( $ 87 k ) . govt affairs also has a contract for support with joe connor ( ex - southern exec ) to support our se activities . i am trying to get a copy of the contract , but i think that it is in place until 8 / 02 . my recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today .

ees is fine with the org . chart below . i understand the $ 6 . 4 million is total for both ena & ees . comments :
1 . ) need a recommended split of the $ 6 . 4 million for ena / ees .
2 . ) i understand the $ 6 . 4 million includes $ 0 for outside services . the ooc of ena / ees needs to approve as these services are needed .
3 . ) the $ 6 . 4 million does include legacy real estate costs . jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs - is this on his radar screen ?
4 . ) we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano . because both ena / ees want to utilize him , i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him . louise / jim - are you both ok with this ? if so , rick / jim , i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box .

here is the org chart that captures our discussions . i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees .
total headcount = 21 . the personnel cost = $ 6 . 4 mm ( total for ena and ees ) .

i think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions . bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for aep , but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash .
if we are short npl 5 and we have an in the money sale to a muni that does not post collateral , we could sell that customer contract to cash - rich marketers - allegheny , duke , aep , dynegy

14139,use of bridgeline credit,"louise :
we gave the attached presentation to bridgeline management with respect to using bridgeline credit to support enron transactions . bridgeline was somewhat positive and i have arranged for enron to make a presentation to the full board at our meeting on thursday .
under one of the proposed credit structures , bridgeline would provide a guarantee to an enron counterparty . enron ' s repayment obligation to bridgeline ( in the event of an enron default ) would be secured by our future dividend payments . we used the el paso transport deal that stephanie and linda r . have been working on as a specific example of how this structure would work , and we plan to present this deal at the thursday meeting .
assuming that the bhlp board approves the credit structure , is this how you want to use this credit support ? specifically , is the el paso transport deal how we should use the available capacity or is there another deal that creates more value ( or relieves more pain ) for enron ? i thought i would check before we got too far down the road .

re : california order proxy price calculation
we have had an initial opportunity to review ferc ' s order establishing prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for the california wholesale electric markets and establishing an investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets , and will provide a more detailed summary early next week .
however , questions have arisen as to the calculation of the proxy price when a stage 1 , 2 or 3 emergency is called . in initial discussions with ferc staff , we have determined that the price mitigation will work as follows :
for the following day , the iso will publish at 8 a . m . an average of the daily prices published in gas daily for all california delivery points , as well as emissions costs . the emissions costs will be calculated by the iso using the cantor fitzgerald environmental brokerage service . the marginal unit will then be determined via the single price auction in the hour , and the iso will then take the previously submitted and confidential heat rate data and multiply it by the posted average gas price and emissions costs for that hour to determine the market clearing price . the iso will not be calculating an estimated market - clearing price in advance .",-1

c . 2001 new york times company
earlier this year , most companies would have loved to have enron ' s problems . californians resented the energy trading company ' s huge profits during their energy crisis , and democrats in washington raised questions about enron ' s influence within the white house and about the cozy relationship between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and vice president dick cheney . nobody seemed better positioned to thrive during the bush presidency than this houston - based apostle of deregulation .
wall street was impressed with enron ' s strategy of swooping into formerly regulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas , electricity or unused telecom bandwidth . the company was celebrated as a paragon of american ingenuity , a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high - tech clearinghouse in an ever - expanding roster of markets . enron ' s push to force utilities into the internet age with its online trading systems , at a seemingly handsome profit , became an epic tale of the dot - com revolution .
it now appears that enron ' s tale may be more cautionary than epic . enron envy has crashed , along with the company ' s stock price , as serious questions emerge about its bookkeeping . enron disclosed earlier this month that $ 1 . 2 billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
most alarming was enron ' s reluctance to shed light on management ' s wheeling and dealing . ' ' related - party transactions , ' ' as the accountants call them , are fraught with conflicts of interest . though much remains to be learned about these transactions , their scope and lack of transparency suggest that enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading . the extent to which company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear .
enron has scrambled to dampen wall street ' s concerns , acknowledging its credibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses . on wednesday it brought in william powers , the dean of the university of texas school of law , to review the transactions . the securities and exchange commission has launched its own formal investigation . mr . fastow was forced to resign , following jeffrey skilling , the man credited with driving enron into new cutting - edge businesses , out the door .
enron ' s former admirers on wall street , mindful of recent scandals involving high - profile companies doctoring their earnings , and of the spectacular collapse of the long - term capital management hedge fund in 1998 , are alarmed . carole coale of prudential securities summed up the prevailing sentiment when she told the times : ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose facts . ' ' analysts , as well as the media , are not entirely blameless . enron did mention , albeit in passing , the troubling related - party deals as early as march 2000 . but few analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company ' s revenues , profits and stock price were soaring .
harvey pitt , the new securities and exchange commissioner , must pursue the enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as vigilant as his predecessor , arthur levitt , when it comes to protecting the integrity of financial markets . indeed , even if enron is cleared of any wrongdoing and regains some of its past luster , as it well might , the company that preaches the merits of self - regulating marketplaces has reminded us all of the need for a strong regulator on wall street .

the enron debacle
byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit ' s credibility
executives at high - flying enron corp . ( ene ) never seemed overly concerned with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices . earlier this year , the california attorney general had to get a court order to collect documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing . and when an analyst challenged former ceo jeffrey k . skilling in a conference call to produce enron ' s balance sheet , skilling called him an "" ass - - - - . "" still , even some enron executives worried that the company had gone too far with two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge investments . with enron ' s then - chief financial officer acting as general manager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their investments , the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from investors seemed overwhelming . "" internally , everybody said this is not a good idea , "" says a source close to the company .
but no one could have predicted such a jaw - dropping outcome for the nation ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . since oct . 16 , when enron revealed a $ 35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnerships and was forced to knock $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholders ' equity , the company ' s stock has plunged 60 % . the securities its highly ballyhooed business for trading high - speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom industry meltdown ; and its calamitous foray into the water business with azurix corp . has already cost enron at least $ 574 million in write - offs .
these bad bets and the expensive ljm shock have investors worried about what else might be lurking at enron . many aren ' t sticking around to find out . "" i think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the credibility of the management team , "" says richard a . giesen , who manages the munder power plus fund , which dumped its enron shares about a month ago .
it ' s not clear just how many off - balance - sheet financing vehicles enron has used over time . some were created years ago to finance oil and gas producers . analysts and sources close to the deals say there ' s no particular risk in these to enron shareholders . other interconnected entities , such as whitewing , osprey , atlantic water trust , and marlin water trust , were a way to get assets no longer central to enron ' s strategy off its balance sheet , freeing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broadband ( table ) .
to entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into these deals , enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren ' t enough to cover debt . such "" mandatory equity "" deals have been used by at least a half - dozen others in the energy and telecom industries , including el paso ( epg ) , williams , and dominion , says standard & poor ' s director todd a . shipman . "" nobody ' s going to find anything that ' s particularly unique or below board "" in such deals , says one investment banker specializing in the energy business .
worst case , which shipman considers unlikely , enron could be on the hook for about $ 3 billion in its mandatory - equity deals . that could mean diluting its shares by more than 25 % at today ' s prices . analyst john e . olson at sanders morris harris inc . ( smhg ) figures a 9 % dilution is more likely . even if this $ 3 billion in debt were included on enron ' s balance sheet now , the debt - to - capital ratio would climb to 54 % from about 49 % at the end of june . such a change would pressure enron ' s credit rating but not push it below investment grade , says shipman .
huge hit . fastow ' s ljm , a private equity fund , was a different kind of animal , according to sources familiar with the arrangements . it bought energy and other assets from enron , which booked gains and losses on those deals . ljm was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the volatility of some of enron ' s investments , including stakes in high - tech and telecom businesses and an interest in new power co . , which markets power to consumers . when enron terminated these deals in september , it took the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity .
but the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with the company . the first place that might show up is in enron ' s highly successful online platform , which trades everything from gas and electricity to weather derivatives . to reassure its partners , enron is scrambling to shore up its liquidity . it has already tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines and is trying to arrange another $ 1 billion . shipman says he has seen no signs of massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms . still , rival traders are wary . "" we certainly have taken a closer look at enron in the last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk , but we ' re still doing business with the company as usual , "" says keith g . stamm , ceo of power and gas trader aquila inc . ( ila )
"" speeding train . "" still , with the stock battered and rating agencies considering further downgrades , that could rapidly change . in recent days , the uncertainty about enron ' s future has reduced investors ' appetite for enron debt . "" no one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of survival , "" says a credit - derivatives salesperson . "" it ' s really difficult to get in front of a speeding train . ""
even if lay can calm his trading partners , he and his management team face a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on wall street . with the stock now hovering around $ 14 - - down from a high of $ 90 in august , 2000 - - some even believe that enron could be a takeover target for the likes of ge capital or royal dutch / shell group . ( rd ) both declined to comment . would enron sell ? one source close to the company says enron has talked about possible mergers and strategic alliances in the past with royal dutch / shell , among others . "" if they ' re really worried about liquidity , they might take the easy way out , "" he says .
if enron does pull through this crisis , some suspect it will be a humbler , more risk - averse place . the company that once believed it could expand its trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities - - from advertising space to steel - - will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions . that ' s something some investors applaud . "" the company should focus on its strengths , "" says william n . adams , senior energy analyst at banc of america capital management , a major shareholder . but that ' s a far less exciting place than enron ' s energy cowboys ever hoped to roam .

derivatives danger ?
lately , owners of enron ' s ( ene ) equity , bonds , and loans have been struggling to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they didn ' t know about before . now , as a fuller picture of enron ' s entanglements with partnerships begins to emerge , investors have something else to worry about : credit default swaps , known as cdss for short .
that ' s financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans . their owners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they have if their investments go bad . the cds market has existed only for about two years , but it ' s growing fast . goldman , sachs & co . ( gs ) and others estimate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $ 1 trillion and $ 1 . 5 trillion are covered . not surprisingly , big banks with hefty balance sheets such as j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) , merrill lynch ( mer ) , and deutsche bank ( db ) dominate the market .
enron , however , is a player - - and the only significant one that isn ' t also a bank . competitors say that although enron has issued only between $ 500 million and $ 700 million worth of cdss so far this year , it had ambitious plans to offer them online . "" they don ' t belong in this market , "" says one trader . "" they don ' t understand the implications . "" enron did not return calls seeking comment .
of course , neither enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans and bonds they ' re insuring turn bad . trouble is , this year is potentially a doozie for losses on corporate debt . corporate defaults could reach a record of $ 100 billion , says standard & poor ' s , like businessweek a unit of the mcgraw - hill companies . regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $ 193 billion by early october .
if enron has insured any of the bad debt , it might have to take charges for losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting . with all that has been happening in recent weeks , that ' s the last thing it needs .

commentary : enron ' s clout won ' t sway the sec
for securities & exchange commission chairman harvey l . pitt , the sec ' s investigation into enron corp . ( ene ) could hardly have come at a worse time . the future of pitt ' s ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation could depend on how well he handles this case .
enron ' s political clout and close ties to president george w . bush create real risks for the sec . enron ceo kenneth l . lay is a longtime bush backer , and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the president ' s campaign . a bush appointee , pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act . he has made it clear he wants to speed up the sec ' s enforcement , in part by rewarding companies that cooperate with probes . but he insists the sec will still come down hard on true corporate miscreants - - and knows that any signs of let - up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda .
enter the enron probe . the fine shadings of securities enforcement - - where most cases are settled by negotiated penalties , not court - imposed fines - - often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the sec is being tough or lenient . but pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the enron case is handled by the book - - getting the same strict scrutiny from the sec as any other , less connected company .
for now , top sec aides say that ' s happening . the sec enforcement div . in washington is looking into whether enron adequately disclosed to shareholders the risks of its complex deals with andrew s . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . agency insiders say pitt and his fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds . but they insist pitt hasn ' t heard from the white house or enron ' s other political allies .
top lobbyist . enron ' s connections are numerous . besides lay ' s links to bush , an enron director , wendy lee gramm , is the wife of texas senator phil gramm , top republican on the senate banking committee . and enron spreads its lobbying budget - - $ 2 . 13 million in 2000 - - across both parties . just this year it hired four lobbying firms with democratic roots . enron says it lobbies heavily because it operates in regulated industries . it notes that electric utilities outspend it 35 to 1 .
on oct . 31 , a special committee of enron ' s board hired william r . mclucas , former sec enforcement director , to represent it . mclucas should know that any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire . pitt , who joined the sec out of law school in 1968 , "" remembers how the [ nixon - era ] sec tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [ fugitive financier ] robert vesco , "" says an agency veteran . pitt has too much riding on the enron probe to let its connections sway his judgment .

afl - cio , amalgamated bank call on enron to redirect the mission of newly created special committee : outside directors must adopt independent role

pr newswire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire )
washington , nov . 2 / prnewswire / - - in a shareholder letter sent today to the board of directors of the enron corporation ( nyse : ene ) , the afl - cio and the amalgamated bank called on enron to expand the mission of its newly created special committee and for enron ' s board to adopt a package of reforms designed to restore investor confidence in the battered energy firm . america ' s working families are significant shareholders of enron stock through their pension , health and welfare benefit funds .
among other suggestions , the letter urges the board to expand the special committee ' s mandate to : * examine all transactions with entities in which enron employees
or directors have an interest
* adopt procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments
* commence an extraordinary review of executive compensation
* adopt a stricter definition of director independence and disclose
director conflicts of interest
"" the special committee ' s mandate is far too narrow to address the current crisis , "" said richard trumka , secretary - treasurer of the afl - cio . "" in light of enron ' s recent balance sheet write - downs , share price decline , and credit rating deterioration , the special committee must be forward looking and consider sweeping governance reform measures , "" he explained .
"" in this time of crisis , outside directors must reform enron ' s traditional lack of transparency and communicate directly with shareholders , "" said gabriel caprio , president and ceo of the amalgamated bank . "" this is particularly important since several outside directors have apparent conflicts of interest that compromise their objectivity , "" he added .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds with over $ 400 billion in assets and hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares . the afl - cio is joined in its call for reform by the amalgamated bank , the trustee of the longview funds which hold 251 , 304 shares of enron . the amalgamated bank ' s longview funds are collective investment trusts that manage equity assets on behalf of workers ' benefit funds .

williams ceo sees validation of co ' s bandwidth model
11 / 02 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - ( dow jones ) - at the beginning of the year , two telecommunications units born of energy companies seemed to symbolize the different ways to sell bandwidth .
enron corp . ( ene ) was viewed as the hot pioneer blazing a trail for selling telecommunications network capacity as a commodity like natural gas or electricity .
on the other hand , williams communications group ( wcg ) seemed to promote the old - fashioned method that telecommunications companies have used for making long - term agreements .
on thursday , wcg reported third - quarter earnings of $ 22 . 6 million before taxes and interest . wcg chairman and chief executive howard janzen told dow jones newswires that the earnings validated williams ' model of a bandwidth company being a provider of services , not a trader of commodities .
"" i think bandwidth trading has its place , "" janzen said . "" it ' s developing relatively slowly . the reality is ( that ) bandwidth is not a commodity except for lower - capacity services and on certain routes with large amounts of capacity . ""
enron reported an $ 80 million third - quarter loss for its broadband services unit .
as janzen views it , bandwidth is defined by the technology used to provide it .
"" the bandwidth we ' ll sell five years from now will be different from what we ' re selling today because of changes in technology , "" he said .
after taxes and interest , williams reported a loss of $ 272 . 7 million on revenue of $ 297 . 8 million in the third quarter . an extraordinary gain of $ 223 . 7 million from the repurchase of senior redeemable notes in the open market enabled williams to post the positive result before taxes and interest .
in the same period a year ago , williams reported a net loss of $ 150 . 5 million on revenue of $ 209 million .
williams also announced thursday that it has agreed to buy the assets of coreexpress , a company which operated on williams ' network . coreexpress guarantees data delivery over multiple networks and developed software to monitor quality of service over multiple networks .
terms of the agreement weren ' t disclosed . the deal won ' t close until undisclosed conditions are met .
williams also announced a 20 - year agreement valued at $ 267 million to provide bandwidth to boeing co .

usa : enron shares plunge after s & p credit rating cut .
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . dropped more than 8 percent in early trade on friday , as the stock took a new plunge in a two - week free - fall , a day after its credit rating was cut for the second time this week .
enron was down 89 cents , or 7 . 4 percent , to $ 11 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after briefly slipping to $ 10 . 95 , a price it also touched briefly on tuesday and last closed at in july 1992 .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , lined up $ 1 billion of new credit on thursday in a bid to restore investor confidence . even so , standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating after stock markets closed on thursday , saying it could do so again if the situation worsens .
enron has been rocked by a stock slide that has slashed two - thirds of its share price since oct . 16 , when the company reported a $ 1 billion charge that was caused , in part , by dealings linked to a chief financial officer who was subsequently ousted .
houston - based enron is facing an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission into those dealings . at issue are off - balance sheet deals with limited partnerships , run by then - cfo andrew fastow , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .

goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
2001 - 11 - 02 11 : 22 ( new york )
goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
new york , nov . 2 ( bloomberg ) - - goldman sachs group inc .
refused to participate in a $ 1 billion loan to enron corp . because
it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling
credit ratings that has been using its investment - banking services
less often , according to people familiar with matter .
enron chief executive kenneth lay asked for the line of
credit after meeting with bankers from goldman , j . p . morgan chase
& co . and citigroup inc . last month to discuss ways to alleviate a
cash crunch . j . p . morgan and citigroup agreed to lend on the
condition that the houston - based energy trader pledge two
pipelines as collateral .
goldman ' s refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit
lines to all but its top fee - paying clients . by not lending to
enron , the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy
enron or some of its assets , or make a bid of its own .
for enron , the decision makes it harder to resist the demands
of its existing lenders , who made the company give up collateral
and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan .
` ` people smell resistance to enron , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an
analyst with creditsights . com , an independent research firm . ` ` the
balance of power is the with the banks now . ' '
kathleen baum , a spokeswoman for goldman , said the firm had
` ` a long history of putting its capital to work for clients . ' ' she
wouldn ' t comment on the firm ' s relationship with enron . karen
denne , a spokeswoman for enron , said , ` ` i won ' t confirm who we
have had talks with . ' '
shut out
enron needed the $ 1 billion secured loan to supplement cash
reserves and help the company pay off existing debt . yesterday ,
standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` bbb , ' '
the second - lowest investment grade rating , from ` ` bbb + . ' '
the sec is investigating partnerships run by former chief
financial officer andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares
and assets . those trades cost enron $ 35 million . the company also
lost $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity .
enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of
commercial - paper markets , where corporations borrow money for days
or weeks . lenders are concerned that the company may have further
losses from its trading business .
a week ago enron tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines , arranged
by j . p . morgan and citibank , to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial
paper it has outstanding .
already loaded down with enron debt , j . p . morgan and citibank
forced enron to pay as much as 2 . 5 percentage points more than the
london interbank offered rate , or libor , on its new loan ,
according to the people familiar with the matter . that ' s about
five times the spread enron is paying on its existing lines ,
according to bloomberg data .
the extra yield wasn ' t sufficient incentive for goldman to
lend . securities firms such as goldman are required to value
lending commitments at market prices , exposing them to potential
losses from declines in loan prices . banks such as j . p . morgan and
citibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value .
falling prices
enron ' s existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and
90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down , according
to traders .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as
much as 6 cents on the dollar today , with price indications
between 68 and 73 cents , traders said . yesterday , traders bid for
the bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 cents
goldman has been getting less investment - banking business
from enron .
the no . 3 u . s . securities firm by capital hasn ' t arranged a
bond sale for enron since 1995 , and enron hasn ' t picked goldman to
advise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993 , according to
bloomberg data . the firm is a dealer on enron ' s $ 3 billion
commercial paper program and has arranged six of the company ' s 15
preferred share sales .
without a steady flow of investment banking fees , goldman is
reluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that is
less profitable than advising on mergers or underwriting
securities .
among clients the firm has turned down : ford motor co . , the
second - largest automaker , and vodafone group plc , europe ' s largest
cellular phone company .
goldman did extend $ 2 billion in credit to at & t corp . as part
of a $ 25 billion credit facility last year . the largest u . s . long -
distance phone company is one of the firm ' s most lucrative
clients , however , paying out more than $ 100 million in investment -
banking fees during the past five years .
after refusing to lend to enron , goldman is unlikely to
advise the energy trader on any of its planned $ 2 . 1 billion in
asset sales , the people familiar said .
j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of its azurix north
american water business and may be retained , along with
citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit , to look at other disposals
and a possible sale of the whole company , the people said .
goldman , which has an energy trading business of its own , may
already be advising potential buyers of enron ' s businesses , or
lining up a bid of its own , reynolds said .
` ` we may well see goldman pop up on the other side , which
would explain its reticence to lend , ' ' he said .
power points : time for a bronx miracle in houston

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on , enron corp . ( ene ) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game .
this is the home run enron must come up with : full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet , and proof the corporation can cover the difference . it ' s what stockholders , bondholders and trading partners have been demanding , but time is running out , and enron hasn ' t produced .
"" we ' re going to get to that number soon and tell people . we have to do that , "" said a source at enron , who didn ' t know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited . "" in this environment , we are going to be absolutely sure that it ' s accurate . ""
enron has about $ 3 . 3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003 . the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and , in a worse case scenario , will face a $ 1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets , enron has said . the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock , shares will be trading closer to $ 20 than their current $ 11 .
investors , however , aren ' t acting as if they ' re reassured . part of the trouble , analysts with credit - rating firm standard & poor ' s said friday morning , is that until enron sells the assets , nobody knows for sure what they ' re worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole .
s & p is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company .
credit derivative fizzle
to see the pickle the world ' s premier energy franchise is in , one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk . that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely , but the desk hasn ' t been able to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron ' s stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee .
enron didn ' t respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are "" constrained "" as the market continues to evaluate the company ' s credit position .
until recently , customers would buy a credit derivative from enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company . a big supplier to a financially troubled company like xerox corp . ( xrx ) or lucent technologies ( lu ) , for example , might pay enron $ 1 million a year for a payout of , say , $ 10 million in the event of a bankruptcy .
but you wouldn ' t pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims . likewise , with enron ' s creditworthiness in doubt , there ' s no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange lucent risk for enron risk .
the same holds true , though less obviously , for enron ' s core business of energy trading . some utilities , large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $ 3 per million british thermal units - shoot to $ 10 this winter as they did last winter .
to guard against that risk , companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices . if a company wants to lock in winter gas at $ 3 , should it turn to enron ? if gas were to rise to $ 10 in january and enron couldn ' t deliver , enron ' s counterparty paid a good price for no protection . and if enron failed in a $ 10 gas market , that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies . gas could go to $ 20 in a heartbeat .
leading role an asset
enron does have a man on base . the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive . and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog .
enron ' s trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point : they are continuing to trade with enron , but are avoiding long - term deals that increase their exposure to the company . the only acceptable long - term deals are those that offset deals done earlier . unless and until a bill goes unpaid , they ' ll keep delivering .
enron , like the rest of the u . s . energy industry , paid its bills for september gas deliveries on oct . 20 and for its september electricity deliveries on oct . 25 . its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of november .
that means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before enron ' s creditworthiness faces another test . in exchange for taking on that small risk , they keep the great market maker in business .
lenders show concerns
lenders , whether through holding enron bonds or providing loans , don ' t have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash . lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time , usually years .
outside of long - term commitments , what worries the banks , which presumably got a good look at enron ' s books ? if enron is now unable to make the big bets with long - term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years , can it service all of its liabilities , known and unknown ? if it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants , or otherwise put those assets at risk , will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs ? what happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere ?
if enron is to have a chance , it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt . so far this year , trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $ 2 . 2 billion out of $ 2 . 4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes . by comparison , enron has made $ 617 million in interest payments so far this year .

enron says it remains ' biggest ' player in eu gas , power

london - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) said in a statement friday that it remains the "" the biggest buyer and seller of gas and power in europe , "" and that its enrononline platform "" continues to be the key trading platform in europe . ""
the company issued the statement in response to widespread rumors that several companies have ceased trading gas and power with enron since its share price took a nosedive last week .
in the statement , enron added that worldwide transactions in the power and gas markets were averaging $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion at close of business friday , oct . 26 .
enron has been on the defensive after announcing a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers .
on wednesday , enron disclosed that the sec elevated its inquiry into enron ' s alleged related - party transactions to a formal probe .
enron corp . secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines this week , but the deal did not appease credit - rating agency standard + 44 - ( 0 ) 20 - 7842 - 9345 ; sarah . spikes @ dowjones . com

usa : update 1 - enron shares fall as investor concerns linger .
by janet mcgurty
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares in enron corp . , the u . s . energy trading giant facing a federal probe into its dealings , declined on friday amid lingering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pending lawsuits .
shares of enron were off 62 cents , or 5 . 2 percent , at $ 11 . 37 in early afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , recouping some losses after plunging briefly to $ 10 . 95 , a closing price last seen in july 1992 and touched in intraday trade on tuesday .
enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points , and was trading at about 65 cents on the dollar . the bonds were trading at about $ 1 . 01 two weeks ago , before enron announced on oct . 16 a $ 1 billion charge , caused in part by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financial officer who was ousted last week , and that form part of the federal probe .
"" there remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be addressed before the clouds can clear above enron ' s skies , "" said ronald barone of brokerage ubs warburg .
apart from the probe by the securities and exchange commission , barone said concerns include "" the evolving state of the company ' s balance sheet , management credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits . ""
a handful of law firms have sued enron , saying it overstated operating results , failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investments that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover loses .
enron ' s woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny , with the company losing about $ 17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks . the afl - cio union umbrella urged enron on friday to review executive compensation and adopt procedures for insider investments , among other recommendations .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares .
premium player in risk management
shares also plunged on friday - they have fallen about two - thirds in the past two weeks - after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating late thursday , the second cut this week .
although s & p said another rate cut could ensue if enron ' s situation worsens , a team of s & p analysts told investors on a conference call on friday they were confident they were aware of all the company ' s financial obligations .
enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings , leading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations .
"" enron is a premium player in the risk management area , "" said ronald barone , a member of the s & p team who is not related to ubs ' s barone .
the s & p analysts said they were using about $ 1 . 5 billion as the amount of off - balance sheet items , about half the $ 3 billion calculated in past years , because of a change in reporting international energy assets , which no longer puts non - recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like india and south america .
the s & p analysts also said they felt enron ' s move to secure a $ 1 billion line of additional credit earlier this week sent out enron ' s clear commitment to credit quality .
they also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long - term solution to fix enron ' s hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long - term equity as well as asset sales .
the s & p ratings team also said it was closely monitoring enron ' s trading partners for a change in their credit stance toward enron and , to date , have seen no significant change .
but they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason for putting enron on the credit watch listing .
enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay , who has been criticized for not providing the public enough details on enron , was a no - show at a business conference in houston where he had been scheduled to speak on friday morning .
enron executive robert bradley , who declined to respond to questions from reuters after his speech , said he had been sent to replace lay because "" ken is better at putting out fires at enron . ""

28008,confidential - - re : august 24 tw conference call minutes,"following up on my "" to do "" from our conference call , the information below
may be useful as we attempt to justify capital / operational expenditures on
the tw system :
objective : try and quantify in revenue terms the lost value of decreased
west throughput to tw
first a few assumptions :
fuel prices used were : permian = $ 4 . 785 / mmbtu and san juan = $ 4 . 14 / mmbtu
baseload volume flowing west was assumed to be 1 , 090 , 000 mmbtu / d
fuel consumed = 2 %
revenue impact is based upon current contracts and assumes lost fuel and
commodity charges only . tw continues to collect the reservation charges .
result :
based on current gas fuel prices , for every 1000 mmbtu / d delivery we lose on
the west end , this translates to approximately $ 150 / day of lost revenue . if
we assume the pressure drop at station 1 is preventing us from delivering
25 , 000 mmbtu / d into socal , then the lost revenue for tw would be $ 3 , 305 per
day or $ 1 , 206 , 000 per year . to give you an idea of the significance of the
fuel value , of the $ 3 , 305 daily revenue , approximately $ 3 , 072 of it is fuel
related .
one more thing :
we assume here that tw continues to collect the reservation charges .
however , on a long term basis , if the west condition continues , we run the
risk of losing the reservation as well . based on 25 , 000 mmbtu / d , this value
equals $ 2 , 500 , 000 per year .
let me know if you have questions . i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 5559

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

we interfaced unify to sap three times today . interface number one ( 8 : 40 am )
was error free . the second interface ( noon ) created duplicate invoices for
those sent in our first interface . the problem that caused the duplication
was that the flag in unify that prevents invoices from being sent to sap
after they have already been interfaced did not work . the problem was
corrected before out third interface at 3 : 15 pm . in the 3 : 15 interface , one
error occurred - - - a counterparty was set up in global as intercompany that
should be third party . this error will be corrected before our next interface
on 7 / 6 am .
overall , i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast
the sap and unify teams responded to our issues .

subject : extension of petro - canada wholesale gas services arrangement for 5 more years
on wednesday the president of petro - canada approved the extension of our wholesale gas services agreement after the first term expires november 1 , 2002 , for an incremental 5 years . this has taken me a a while to get closed ( and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service ) , but keep in mind it ' s not easy to renew something half way through the first term .
this extension is very significant for the following reasons :
1 . it creates a mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn , net of directly attributable costs to provide the back - office services ;
2 . it supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income ( along with all the production information etc . ) ;
3 . of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across canada . as you know , we have used the petro - canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide , not only when marketing in canada but also in the us and europe . now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years , but they ' ve liked it so much they ' ve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service .
obviously this is a great credit to our commercial staff and the operations , accounting and it staff that work with petro - canada . i will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them . it takes alot of effort to "" enchant "" the customer day after day , year after year . in fact it ' s incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider .
the numbers :
under the extension , we have provided petro - canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee .
original base fee is $ 1 . 75 mm cdn per year , payable monthly .
rebate offered :
jan / 01 - nov / 01 ( $ 458 , 300 ) cdn
nov / 01 - nov / 02 ( $ 517 , 000 ) cdn
fee charged for extension term :
nov / 02 - nov / 03 $ 1 , 366 , 000 cdn
nov / 03 - nov / 04 $ 1 , 400 , 000 cdn
nov / 04 - nov / 05 $ 1 , 435 , 000 cdn
nov / 05 - nov / 06 $ 1 , 470 , 000 cdn
nov / 06 - nov / 07 $ 1 , 510 , 000 cdn
we have thoroughly defined our back - office costs required to provide these services at $ 428 , 700 cdn / yr ( 2000 $ ) , and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection ( with escalation at 2 % per year ) for the second five year term . these costs include back - office staff allocations ( salaries and benefits ) , and rent / infrastructure allocation . we have checked on the allocation of houston costs , and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels . we do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow .
in discussions with wes , this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope , will allow us to mtm this income . the mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term , and has been reduced by the above annual costs .
notes :
1 . we have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with pcog on what our benchmark should be , given that much of the intermediate producers in the group of 40 have disappeared . we will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to .
2 . if petro - canada ' s sales volumes fall to 60 % of last years levels , there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate . we also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140 % of today ' s levels . petro - canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected . volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7 - 8 % year on year .
3 . peter and i should have the amended agreement out next week .",-1

i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .
thank you for your patience .",-1

subject : anniversary
hi , sistas -
here ' s the scoop on the josephine house :
we can reserve with just a credit card ; no deposit required .
parties under 20 : $ 200 room fee . $ 50 valet parking fee .
i confirmed "" 17 "" with mom .
heidi sent some sample menus . a 3 - course menu ( appetizer or salad , entree ,
dessert ) is $ 45 .
a 4 - course ( same as 3 - course plus hors d ' oeuvres ) sample menu is $ 52 .
each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course . the
food sounds really good .
so , here ' s a guess at cost :
17 people at $ 45 = $ 765
beverages = $ 200
gratuity = $ 193
valet = $ 50
room rental = $ 200
total $ 1408 , or $ 469 per family if we divide it into
thirds
what do you guys think ? should we explore other options - or just go with
this ? i think chris and i would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn ' t go crazy with gift and decorations too . so , if we really
want to do the photo ( s ) - do we have a cost for these yet ? , we may want to
consider other options . thoughts ? - cara

alex ,
paulo and i have continued to look at the model and have come up with a
couple of additional changes .
1 . the cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike
payment . also , paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values .
2 . i would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree
approach to a one - dimensional integration , perhaps using a quadrature
method . this may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities .
3 . edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for
anything . if it is , we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma .

i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
